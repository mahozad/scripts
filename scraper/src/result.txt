* Absorbent	An absorbent is a liquid stream used in an absorption separation process to take up the component being separated.  
* Absorption	Absorption is a type of separation process used in refining in which a component in a mixed stream is selectively taken up by a liquid stream (absorbed), separating it from other components in the mix. The absorbed chemical is typically then separated from the absorbing liquid (absorbent) by fractionation.  
* Acid gas recovery	Also known as: Gas scrubber, Amine unit, Girbotol Many of the conversion and hydrotreating units generate refinery gas that contains a mix of H2S and CO2, called acid gas. The acid gas recovery units extract the H2S from the other gas components using an amine solvent. Once separated, the H2S can then be sent to the sulfur plant to recover the sulfur. How it works The refinery gas is fed into a vessel and mixed with an alkylamine solution. The amine absorbs the acid gas, leaving a clean refinery gas stream that can be sent to the gas plant. The acid-gas-rich amine stream is sent to a regenerator/separation vessel and heated with steam, causing the dissolved acid gas to come out of the solution so it can be drawn off and sent to the sulfur plant. There are a number of different alkylamine solvents that can be used. The most common are: Diethanolamine (DEA) Monoethanolamine (MEA) Methyl-Diethanolamine (MDEA) Diisopropanolamine (DIPA) Diglycolamine (DGA) Hot potassium carbonate  
* Acid number	Also known as: TAN, Total acid number The total acid number (or TAN) of a crude oil is a measure of the corrosiveness of the crude due to the presence of acids, particularly naphthenic acids. TAN is measured based on the mg of potassium hydroxide required to neutralize one gram of crude. Generally, an acid number of anything over 1 is considered high. Refiners have four options for dealing with high acid crude: Dilution - Often high-acid crudes are mixed with low-acid grades to reduce the average TAN to a level that does not pose a corrosion risk Neutralization - High-acid crude can also be neutralized with caustic as it is fed into the distillation tower by injecting the caustic directly into the crude stream Corrosion inhibitors - Phosphorus-based corrosion inhibitors can be injected into the crude and allowed to coat metal surfaces, reducing the likelihood of corrosion. Inhibitors are also often injected into the parts of the process units where the acidic components can create the highest degree of corrosion Metallurgy - The metals used for key pieces of equipment can by upgraded to more corrosion-resistant stainless steels containing molybdenum and other corrosion-resistant alloys  
* Additives	Additives are chemicals that are added to refined products in very small volumes to improve the product properties without adding volume. This is in contrast to blendstocks, which change average product properties but also contribute additional volume. Additives are typically introduced downstream from the refinery, often as product is loaded onto tank trucks at the terminal rack for final delivery.
* Adsorbent	An adsorbent is a solid material used in an adsorption separation process to extract a component from a liquid or gas mixture.  
* Adsorption	Adsorption is a refinery separation process that uses a solid medium to extract a component from a mixture. In adsorption, the component being extracted physically attaches itself to the adsorbent solid.  
* Aframax	Aframax refers to a class of oil tanker of medium size, larger than Panamax and smaller than Suezmax. Aframax tankers are in the range of 80-120 DWT. The typical drafts vary by vessel but are usually in the region of 14.5-15.5 m. They are used for crude and refined products shipment. If moving product, they are often called LR2. Aframax crude tankers are typically used in short- to medium-distance routes and to serve ports that cannot handle the larger and lower-cost-per-barrel Suezmax or VLCC tankers. The name Aframax comes from an oil tanker rate system introduced by Shell called the Average Freight Rate Assessment.

* Alkylate	Alkylate is the primary product of the alkylation unit, which converts light olefins (such as butylene) into a high-quality gasoline blendstock by reacting it with isobutane. There are several types of alkylate, based on the different olefins used to produce it. The most common and desirable is C4 alkylate, which is produced from alkylating (joining) butylene with isobutane. However, alkylate can also be made from propylene and isobutane, or pentene and isobutane. C4 alkylate is preferred because it has the most desirable properties for gasoline blending, high octane, and low vapor pressure. All alkylates also benefit from containing no aromatic components. Properties Alkylate is considered a premium gasoline blendstock because of its combination of properties: Low sulfur content - Alkylate has no sulfur Low aromatics content - Alkylate contains no aromatics Low vapor pressure - Alkylate has a low vapor pressure C4 alkylate has an RVP of 2.6 psi C3 alkyate has an RVP of 3.8 psi C5 alkylate has an RVP of 4.0 psi High octane - Alkylate has medium to high octane depending on the type C4 alkylate has a RON of 94-98 (MON of 92-94) C3 alkylate has a RON of 89-92 (MON of 88-90) C5 alkylate has a RON of 90-92 (MON of 88-93)   
* Alkylation unit	Also known as: alky In refining, the alkylation unit produces a high-quality gasoline blendstock by combining two LPG-range molecules to form one gasoline-range molecule. This involves reacting isobutane with some type of light olefin, typically either propylene or butylene coming from the FCC. The economic value of the alkylation unit comes from its ability to upgrade low-value light ends (C3s and C4s) to a high-value gasoline blendstock, one that has a premium quality with relatively high octane properties and no aromatic components. Alkylation units have become more popular as aromatics limits on gasoline have been tightened. The alky relies on, and complements, the FCC. Most, if not all, of the light olefins generated in a refinery come from the FCC unit. The capacity and/or throughput of the alky are typically limited by the availability of the olefin to feed it. How it works A mixture of isobutane and light olefins (either C4s, C3s, or a mix) is injected into a series of reaction chambers filled with an acid catalyst. The acid is either sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or hydrofluoric acid (HF). The catalyst causes the isobutane to combine with the olefin to produce either a C8 or C7 naphtha-range product called alkylate. The isobutane used to feed the alky is produced throughout the refinery as a product of other conversion processes. Typically, this is supplemented with isobutane produced intentionally in a C4 isomerization unit. The olefin feed for the alky primarily comes from the FCC unit. In general, refiners will preferentially feed the alky with butylene, because this yields the highest quality alkylate (octane and vapor pressure). Also, butylene has a lower-valued alternative use than propylene. Propylene will also be used whenever there is insufficient volume of butylene available and/or it is not possible to sell the propylene as a separate product. C5 olefins (amylenes) are also used at times as a supplemental feed. However, this is less common. The primary product from an alkylation unit is C5+ alkylate. The volume and quality of the alkylate will depend on the olefin feed used (butylene or propylene) and the operating conditions for the unit, but all alkylates benefit from having a zero level of aromatic components. The alky unit will also yield any saturated propane and/or butane that was present in the feed. The alky produces a small amount of alkylate bottoms.  
* American Petroleum Institute	Also known as: API The API is an organization for the US oil industry. It lobbies for the industry on policy issues and also sets some industry standards.  
* Aniline point	The aniline point is a measure of the paraffinicity of a stream, and thus its ignition quality as a diesel blendstock. Aniline point is measured as the temperature at which equal volumes of the stream and aniline are completely miscible.  
* Anode grade coke	Anode grade coke is a high-quality, specialty grade of pet coke used to make anodes for the aluminum and steel industries. Anode grade coke is made from green coke that is low in sulfur and metals, and must be calcined before being baked into anodes.  
* Anti-knock index	Also known as: AKI, DON, R+M/2 The anti-knock index is a measure of gasoline octane that attempts to capture both the measure of research octane and motor octane in one number. It is most commonly used in the US and Canada, where it is the primary indicator of octane provided to consumers at the pump. In most other markets, road octane alone is the primary indicator of octane quality.  
* APC	Also known as: Advanced process control APC is a system employed in refinery process units to set process conditions using automated monitoring and evaluation of process conditions and a computer-based determination of optimal conditions.  
* API gravity	API gravity is a commonly used index of the density of a crude oil or refined products. API stands for the American Petroleum Institute, which is the industry organization that created this measure. Calculation of API gravity API is calculated from a hydrocarbon's specific gravity using this formula: API = (141.5/Specific Gravity) - 131.5  API gravity of crude oil grades A crude oil will typically have an API between 15 and 45 degrees. Higher API indicates a lighter (lower density) crude. Lower API indicates a heavier (more dense) crude. Generally, lighter (high API) crudes are more valuable because they yield more high-value light products when run through a refinery. Light crude is typically in the 35-45 API range, which includes most of the highest valued crudes such as Brent and WTI. Crudes lighter than 45 are typically considered extra-light crude or condensates and are valued lower than light crude because they contain a lot of light ends such as propane and butane. A medium crude is in the 25-35 API range, and a heavy crude is in the 15-25 API range. Anything below 15 API would be considered an extra-heavy crude.  
* ARA	Also known as: Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp ARA refers to the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp in the Northwest Europe refining hub market. Spot transactions for refined products in these ports are commonly used as indicators for the Northwest Europe market overall, and are thus called "ARA basis." These ports are used as a reference because they all have deep, active trading markets and are close enough to each other to be considered interchangeable.  
* Arab Light crude	Also known as: ARL Arab Light is a medium-gravity, high-sulfur crude oil produced by Saudi Arabia. It is the major export grade for Saudi Arabia and a global crude benchmark. Arab Light is mainly produced from the super giant Ghawar field, but it also contains volumes from other fields. Arab Light is marketed in all of the major refining centers including Europe, Asia, and North America. Arab Light is priced using regional formulas based on benchmarks in each of the regions. Quality: API: 33.0 Sulfur: 1.77%  
* Arbitrage	Arbitrage is a market condition where the difference in two prices creates an opportunity to make a profit. For example, when the price of a single commodity in two locations is greater than the cost of moving the product from one location to the other. In an efficient market, competition should cause arbitrages to disappear.  
* Arctic diesel	Also known as: Winterized diesel Arctic diesel is a special grade of diesel for use at low temperatures. Blending Arctic diesel to have better cold flow properties at low temperatures (lower cloud point) generally results in a lower energy content than standard diesel.  
* Argus	Also known as: Petroleum Argus Argus is one of the major oil price assessment agencies and industry news services for crude and refined products (along with Platts). Argus provides daily price assessments for most major crude oil grades around the world and for most of the major refined products in big trading hubs such as Northwest Europe, the US Gulf Coast, and Singapore. Argus also publishes newsletters providing market commentary.   
* Aromatics (content)	Aromatics are hydrocarbons containing a benzene ring of six unsaturated carbon atoms. Benzene is the the smallest, most basic aromatic compound, but other common ones include toluene and xylene. Aromatics in petroleum products Aromatics are an important element in gasoline blending because they are a key source of highly valued octane. However, some aromatics are also toxic to humans and a contributor to smog when released into the atmosphere. As a result, refiners typically try to maximize the aromatics content of gasoline up to a limit set to address environmental concerns. Regulations typically limit both the overall volume percent of aromatics and the volume percent of benzene in particular. Aromatics are very undesirable in distillates such as jet fuel and diesel, where they tend to lower smoke point and cetane, respectively. Aromatics in refinery feedstocks Aromatics content also has an effect on how well a hydrocarbon performs in some conversion units. In particular, highly-aromatic compounds tend to crack very poorly in an FCC unit. Highly aromatic streams can also be used to make aromatics products such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. All of these are important feedstocks to petrochemicals. Consequently, many refiners will extract these products from reformate and sell them as final products. 
* Aromatics (products)	Aromatics are any hydrocarbons that contain a benzene ring (six carbon, unsaturated ring). In a refinery, aromatics products mostly come from the BTX plant, where they are extracted from the reformate produced in the reformer. BTX plants also source pygas from steam crackers for aromatics extractions. The most common aromatics produced by refiners are: Benzene Toluene Xylene Most refineries do not have BTX extraction and leave all of the produced aromatics in the reformate blended into gasoline. Consequently, aromatics are generally considered a specialty product. 
* Aromatics extraction unit	Also known as: base oil aromatics extraction, phenol extraction, NMP extraction, furfural The aromatics extraction unit is a solvent extraction unit used to remove aromatics from vacuum gasoil in order to make base oil. Alternative processes use phenol or NMP (N-methyl-2 pyrrolidine) as the solvent.
* ASCI	Also known as: Argus sour crude index ASCI is a spot market price assessment for medium sour crude in the US Gulf Coast market. It is used as a marker for grades such as Mars and Poseidon. ASCI is assessed and published by Argus.
* Aspen Tech	Aspen is an industry software firm that is best known in the downstream oil industry for its optimization and scheduling tools, especially the PIMS LP model.
* Asphalt	Also known as: bitumen, road oil Asphalt is the densest liquid refined product produced by a refinery, but it only stays liquid if stored and transported heated. It becomes a solid if allowed to cool to normal atmospheric temperatures. Asphalt is primarily made up of large, dense molecules called asphaltenes. The major uses for asphalt are as a binder for road paving and in construction materials such as asphalt roofing shingles. Although asphalt is generally valued lower than crude oil, it is considered a value-adding product because it is made from the densest, lowest-value part of crude oil, the vacuum resid, yet it is typically valued higher than residual fuel oil. So the value to a refinery from making asphalt comes not from the high value of the product, but from the low cost of the feedstock. Only a very limited number of refineries produce any asphalt because of the relatively small end market, so it is generally considered to be one of the specialty products.
* Asphalt plant	The asphalt unit extracts asphaltenes from vacuum resid for use as asphalt cement. There are two major processes for asphalt production: Propane de-asphalting - A solvent extraction process extracting asphaltenes using propane as a solvent Super-critical extraction - Super-critical temperature extraction using multiple solvents
* Asphaltenes	Asphaltenes are large, high-density hydrocarbons found in the heaviest distillation fractions of crude oil. Asphaltenes are the primary components of the product asphalt. High asphaltene content is desirable for a refiner producing asphalt, but undesirable if the asphaltene-containing resid is intended for fuel oil blending or feed to conversion units. Asphaltenes include a large number of different hydrocarbon molecules. The primary definition of an asphaltene is that it is insoluble in n-heptane but soluble in toluene.
* Assay	Also known as: Crude assay A crude assay is a detailed chemical analysis of a crude oil that can be used to predict the volume and quality of refined products that will result from processing the crude in a refinery. The assay includes an estimate of the volumes of different distillation cuts or fractions that will result from processing a crude through a crude distillation unit. This is described in terms of the volume of crude that evaporates at different temperature ranges (or boiling points). Typically, an assay contains nine distillation cuts ranging from refinery gas to vacuum residuum. For each distillation cut, the assay will also provide a number of quality characteristics. These include properties that affect how the cut will perform when processed through a conversion unit (e.g., density, concarbon, N+2A) and properties that affect the quality of any product that the cut is blended directly into (e.g., cetane, octane, sulfur).
* Asset values	Refineries are generally highly valued assets, worth in the hundreds of millions to multiple billions of dollars. This reflects both the high capital cost of building a refinery and the high cash flows that an operating refinery will typically generate. There are a number of ways a refinery’s value can be measured, depending upon the decision being considered: Replacement cost – Replacement costs estimate the cost of constructing a refinery at current construction market conditions. This is typically built up based on the cost of each individual process unit, plus land, and a scale up for infrastructure, tankage, and location adjustments Net-Present Value of cash flows (NPV or DCF) – The value of a refinery as a continuing business is best estimated based on a forecast of future cash flows, discounted to the present. This method is the most transparent, but it is also highly sensitive to forecasts of future market conditions, which is fraught with uncertainty EBITDA multiples – Using reported financial data from peer companies (pure play refiners) allows for an estimate of a refiner's value based on its current or recent profitability. Comparing the peer companies’ ratio of company value to recent EBITDA gives a ratio that can then be applied to a specific refiner or refinery’s current EBITDA to get a value. This provides a good estimate of how the financial market would value the business if publicly listed. However, this method is limited by the availability of truly comparable peers and of a good estimate of the target refinery’s current/recent EBITDA Transaction values - Refineries are bought and sold frequently, either entirely or through partial ownership. It is not unusual to have up to a dozen transactions globally in a single year. Reported transaction values give an indication of what the market is willing to pay for a refinery. However, adjusting for comparability can be tricky. Capacity and complexity number can be used to adjust for differences in size and configuration, but this can still leave a big difference if market location and operations performance is unaccounted for. Also, it is important to consider how the value of hydrocarbon inventories was accounted for, given the large impact these can have on overall transaction value
* Associated gas	Associated gas is natural gas that is produced along with crude oil, and typically separated from the oil at the wellhead. In contrast, non-associated gas is produced from a well that does not also produce crude oil. 
* ASTM	Also known as: American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM is a standards organization (like ISO) that sets quality standards and defines testing methods for refined products.
* Atmospheric bottoms	Also known as: atmospheric resid, atmospheric residue, reduced crude, long residue, atmospheric reduced crude, topped crude Atmospheric bottoms is the heaviest of the distillation cuts out of the atmospheric distillation tower. It consists of all of the components of crude oil that have boiling points above about 650F (343C). These cuts cannot be vaporized in the atmospheric distillation tower because they begin to crack or break down at the temperatures required to achieve vaporization. Consequently, they remain in liquid form during the atmospheric distillation process and literally come out of the "bottom" of the tower. Typically, atmospheric bottoms is sent to a secondary distillation tower, the vacuum distillation unit. Here it is distilled under a vacuum, which allows the unit to operate at temperatures that do not result in cracking. This yields VGO and vacuum resid that can then be upgraded to yield light products. In the absence of a vacuum distillation tower, atmospheric bottoms may be blended into residual fuel oil. However, this is typically a lower value use than upgrading. Additionally, for crude oils that are light and sweet, it is possible to feed their atmospheric bottoms directly into an special version of the FCC called an RCC or resid catalytic cracker.
* Atmospheric distillation	Also known as: atmospheric tower, pipe still, crude unit, primary distillation, crude distillation unit, CDU, fractional distillation Atmospheric distillation is the first and most fundamental step in the the refining process. The primary purpose of the atmospheric distillation tower is to separate crude oil into its components (or distillation cuts, distillation fractions) for further processing by other processing units. Atmospheric distillation typically sets the capacity limit for the entire refinery. All crude oil processed must first go through atmospheric distillation. Also atmospheric distillation typically provides most of the feed for the other process units in the refinery. In most refineries, the bottoms from the atmospheric distillation tower will be sent to the vacuum tower for further separation. The design and operation of the atmospheric distillation tower will limit the type of crude that the refinery can process, further limiting the volume and quality of feed to other process units. How it works Crude oil is first heated to about 700-750F (400C). The heated crude is injected into the lower part of the distillation column, where much of it vaporizes. As the vapors rise through the tower, they pass through a series of perforated trays or structured packing. As the vapors cool, their components will condense back into liquid at different levels in the tower based on their boiling point. A portion of the vapors reaches the top of the column, where it is cooled through heat exchangers and air coolers and partly converted back into liquid. A portion of this is fed back into the distillation column as a reflux stream to contact with the rising vapors, helping to cool them. This effect of counter-current flows of rising vapors meeting falling cooler liquids allows equilibrium conditions to be established throughout the column. The lighter (less-dense) hydrocarbons will condense at higher points in the distillation tower, heavier hydrocarbons will condenser lower down. This results in separation of the hydrocarbons based on the different temperatures at which they boil/condense. Hydrocarbons are drawn off of the tower at different heights to get a set of streams of different boiling points. These different streams are called distillation cuts or fractions. These individual streams are then sent to other units for further processing or to finished product blending. The heaviest fractions of the crude do not vaporize and are drawn off at the bottom of the tower as atmospheric bottoms. These are sent to the vacuum distillation for further fractionation under a vacuum. Crude with high salt content will typically be processed through a desalter before going to distillation, to remove salts that could cause corrosion in the distillation tower. Inputs The primary input to an atmospheric distillation unit is crude oil. This can be a single crude oil or a mixture of several different crude oil grades. A refinery may also re-process a mixture of unfinished or off-spec products (called slops) by blending with fresh crude oil and sending the blend to the distillation unit. Products The outputs from distillation are distillation cuts. Typically, a crude distillation unit will have the following distillation cuts: Refinery gas - Made up of methane and ethane. This stream remains a gas and is used as fuel for the refinery Light ends - Stream containing primarily propane and butane. It is sent to the sat gas plant for further separation Light straight run naphtha - Sold as a feedstock for petrochemicals, blended directly into gasoline or upgraded through isomerization Heavy naphtha - Mostly upgraded through the reformer but sometimes blended directly into gasoline Kerosene - Used to make jet fuel or blended into diesel Atmospheric gasoil - Used to make diesel or converted to gasoline through upgrading in the FCC Atmospheric bottoms - Contains all of the hydrocarbons that do not vaporize in the atmospheric distillation tower. It is typically fed to the vacuum distillation unit for further separation For a specific crude oil grade, the typical volumes and qualities of these distillation cuts are detailed in the crude assay.
* Atmospheric gasoil	Also known as: light gasoil, distillate, AGO, LAGO, HAGO Atmospheric gasoil is a distillation cut derived from an atmospheric distillation unit, and it is primarily made up of molecules with 14 to 20 carbon atoms. The AGO distillation has a boiling range between 420 and 650F (215-343C) The primary use of atmospheric gasoil is as a blendstock to make diesel or heating oil. However, it must typically go through a distillate hydrotreater first to remove sulfur. Diesel is more typically blended from the lighter end of AGO, called light atmospheric gasoil or LAGO. The heavier end of AGO, called heavy atmospheric gasoil or HAGO, can also be fed into the FCC when a refinery is trying to maximize the yield of gasoline over diesel.
* Availability	In refining, availability refers to the processing capacity of a refinery or individual processing unit that is actually available to be used, as opposed to the name plate or design capacity. There are two levels of capacity availability that refiners measure: Mechanical availability - Capacity that is physically operable given the hardware constraints of the plant Operational availability - Capacity that is operable given both mechanical availability and any operational constraints such as feedstock availability
* Aviation gasoline	Also known as: Avgas Avgas is a gasoline-range refined product that is used in aircrafts.

============ B ============
* Back haul	Back haul is the return voyage for a tanker after delivering its primary cargo. An empty back haul results in a higher cost for shipping the primary cargo. On routes where empty back hauls are common, the back haul is a potential low cost way to ship a commodity.
* Backwardation	Backwardation is a market condition where prices for a commodity in the future are lower than current or prompt prices. In a backwardated market, there is an incentive to draw down inventories to capture higher prices before they decline. Utilization of storage facilities tends to decline during backwardated market periods. Backwardation is the opposite market condition to contango.
* Barge	Barges are non-ocean-going tankers used to transport crude oil and refined products in coastal waters and inland waterways. Barges are smaller than other tankers and have flat bottoms that allow them to navigate in shallow waters. Areas with very active barge markets will have spot market transactions quoted for barge cargoes. Because these are smaller than tanker cargoes, they are generally higher in price.
* Barrel	Also know as: BBL Barrel is a common measure of volume used in the oil industry, for both crude oil and refined products. A barrel is equal to 42 US gallons. The typical alternative measure is weight (in tons). The relationship between tons and barrels varies with a commodity's density.
* Base oils	Also known as: lubes Base oils are one of the specialty products that can be produced by a refinery. Base oils are not a fuel. They are blendstocks used to formulate a variety of lubricating oils for use in engines and other machinery. Base oils are produced by extracting and treating high-viscosity material from narrow distillation cuts of vacuum gasoil or vacuum resid. This requires special processing through a number of different units comprising the lubes plant. Producing base oil is typically very profitable for a refinery, because it allows the refiner to take some of the lowest valued part of crude oil, vacuum gasoil, or vacuum resid, and sell it as a high-valued specialty product. However, base oil production facilities have a relatively high capital cost per barrel, so only a subset of refiners have installed them.
* Batch process	A batch process is one in which processing happens in discrete parcels or batches, rather than continuously (continuous process). Most refining processes are continuous (not batch) processes. An important exception is a delayed coker, where the thermal reaction is continuous, but the accumulation of coke in the coke drums is a batch process requiring the drums to be taken out of service to be emptied.
* Battery limits	Battery limits are the area directly around an individual process unit or a refinery, which encompasses all of the parts of the unit or plant.
* Benchmark (operations)	Operations benchmarks are measures of typical industry performance on specific operational dimensions. These are used to compare an individual refinery's operational performance against the rest of the industry to identify areas of strength and weakness. Benchmarks are used on a wide variety of operational measures, including: Unit availability Operating costs Yield Factor inputs (energy, labor, catalyst, chemicals, etc) Benchmarks are typically either average values for the whole industry or for quartiles reflecting best to worst performance groups. Benchmarks are typically normalized for the size and complexity of the refinery to provide more meaningful comparison. In refining, the industry standard set of benchmarks is compiled by Solomon Associates and is used widely across the industry, around the world.
* Benchmark (price)	Also known as: Marker A benchmark is a price quote for a crude grade or product that is used as a reference for pricing other crudes or products. Typically, benchmarks are for a highly traded commodity, with a quality and location that are similar to other commodities. Some examples are: Brent crude, FOB in the North Sea WTI crude, in Cushing Gasoline, Mean of Platts Singapore
* Benzene	Benzene is a hydrocarbon with six carbon atoms in an unsaturated aromatic ring structure. Benzene is the most fundamental of the aromatic hydrocarbons. In gasoline, benzene content is limited because it is a known carcinogen and a contributor to smog formation. However, benzene is an important feedstock to the petrochemicals industry, so many refiners produce and extract benzene to sell as a finished product. The primary source of benzene in a refinery is from the reformate produced in the reformer.
* BFOE	Also known as: Brent Forties Oseberg Ekofisk, 21-day BFOE BFOE is a forward contract for light-sweet North Sea crude oil that can be satisfied with any of four grades of crude: Brent, Forties, Oseberg, or Ekofisk. The contract was created to add volume to the market for Brent as production from the Brent field has declined. 
* Biofuels	Also known as: Renewable fuels Biofuels are non-oil based fuels produced from agricultural products (e.g., bioethanol, biodiesel). Biofuels are typically used as a blendstock in conjunction with conventional oil-based fuel blendstocks to make diesel and gasoline. The use of biofuels is largely driven by government mandates that require a minimum level of biofuels blending. Types of biofuels There are a variety of different biofuels currently used to satisfy renewable fuels mandates, the most common are: Bioethanol - ethanol produced from agricultural sugars or starch (from corn, sugarcane, beets or wheat) through a fermentation process. Also small amounts produced from cellulosic feedstocks Biodiesel (FAME) - diesel blendstock produced from vegetable oils or animal fats using a transesterification process. Yields a diesel blendstock that can be blended in low volumes (typically 5%), limited by cold flow properties Renewable diesel - high-quality diesel blendstock produced from hydroprocessing of vegetable oils or animal fats Bio-ETBE - an ether produced from bioethanol and isobutylene used as a renewable gasoline blendstock, especially in Europe  
* Blend stock	A blendstock is any unfinished oil that is blended with other similar unfinished oils to make a final refined product. Most blendstocks are produced and used inside the same refinery. However, some are traded in the market, either between refiners or with third-party product blenders.
* BOB	Also known as: Before oxygenate blending A BOB is an unfinished (intermediate) gasoline blend that only lacks the addition of the predetermined volume of ethanol to be finished gasoline. BOBs are widely traded (rather than finished blends) because of the challenges of moving blends that already contain ethanol. Common example of BOBs are: CBOB - A BOB that will result in conventional, regular grade gasoline when blended with 10% ethanol RBOB - A BOB that will result in reformulated, regular grade gasoline when blended with 10% ethanol CARBOB - A BOB that will result in CARB grade, regular grade gasoline when blended with 10% ethanol
* BOE	Also known as: Barrels of oil equivalent BOE is a measure of hydrocarbon volume (typically used for natural gas) in terms of the barrels of crude oil that would have the same energy content. BOE is typically used as a way of comparing natural gas volumes to crude oil when measuring reserves or production. There is no single standard conversion factor for BOE, but a common one is 5,500 cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent.
* Boiling point	The boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid hydrocarbon vaporizes. For a pure stream, this would be at a single temperature. However, as most hydrocarbon streams in a refinery are a mix of different components, they tend to boil across a temperature range. At the low end is the initial boiling point where components first begin to vaporize, and at the high end is the final boiling point where the last components to boil vaporize. This range of temperatures is often referred to as the boiling range.
* Boiling range	The boiling range is a range of temperatures across which the components in a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons boil. In refining, a boiling range is used to define a distillation fraction for a crude oil grade.
* Bonny Light crude	Bonny Light is a light-sweet crude oil grade produced in Nigeria. It is an important benchmark crude for all West African crude production. Bonny Light has particularly good gasoline yields, which has made it a popular crude for US refiners, particularly on the US East Coast. Quality: API: 34.5 Sulfur: 0.14%
* Break-even	Break-even refers to a market condition where prices are at levels that result in a marginal source of supply operating at zero variable cash profitability (i.e., just breaking even on the last unit supplied). A common example is break-even for the marginal refining configuration in a hub market.
* Brent	Brent is a light sweet grade of crude oil produced in the North Sea. Brent plays a uniquely important role in the global oil industry by acting as a benchmark crude against which most other crude grades are priced. Brent is important as a regional benchmark for a large number of light sweet crude oils produced in the North Sea. It is also used as a global benchmark for overall global crude prices. Brent's role as a benchmark is reinforced by its active forward and derivatives markets. Quality: API: 37.5 Sulfur: 0.40%
* Bright stock	Bright stock is a high-viscosity, paraffinic base oil produced from vacuum resid by means of solvent extraction of asphaltenes, wax, and aromatics.
* BS&W	Also known as: basic sediment and water BS&W refers to the volume of non-hydrocarbon contaminants contained in a cargo of crude oil. Usually, this is made up of dirt (sediment) and water. Lower BS&W is better. Acceptable levels of BS&W are 1% or lower. Sediment and water are separated from crude typically by letting the crude rest in a storage tank until the sediment and water settle to the bottom. Water can be pumped out, but sediment usually accumulates in the tank until the tank is taken out of service and cleaned. 
* BTC pipeline	Also known as: Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline BTC is a major crude oil pipeline that brings Caspian crude to the Mediterranean. The pipeline starts in Baku, Azerbaijan, passes through Tbilisi, Georgia, and terminates on the Southeastern coast of Turkey, in Ceyhan. From Ceyhan, crude is loaded onto tankers and moved to refineries around the Mediterranean and east to Asian refiners.
* Btu	Also known as: British thermal unit Btu is a measure of energy content commonly used in the oil and gas industry. A Btu is equivalent to 1,055.06 joules.
* BTX unit	Also known as: Aromatics plant, aromatics extraction The BTX unit extracts aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene) from reformate for use as petrochemical feedstocks. Pygas from a steam cracker can also be a feedstock for BTX units.
* Bullet	A bullet is a specialized product storage tank for LPG. It gets its name from its bullet shape: a cylinder with rounded ends. The shape provides strength against the pressure coming from the LPG inside.
* Bunker fuel	Also known as: Bunker, Bunkers Bunker fuel is any fuel used on board a ship. The most commonly used type is residual fuel oil bunker or Bunker C. Grades of Bunker fuel Bunker A - Gasoil range bunker fuel, typically called marine diesel or marine gasoil Bunker B - Low-viscosity vac resid range bunker fuel. Typically cut with some lighter material (VGO) to reduce viscosity to the point that it will flow without heating Bunker C - The most common form of bunker. Composed primarily of vac resid range material, with a high viscosity that requires heating in order to pump. Typically sold at several viscosity specifications: 180 centistoke, 380 centistoke, or 460 centistoke, with 380 being the most common grade. The viscosities are measured at 50C, the typical heated temperature of the fuel In addition, the bunker fuel which can be used in the Sulfur Emissions Control Areas (SECAs) must have a maximum sulfur content of 0.1%, which requires either using Bunker A or a Ultra Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (ULSFO). SECAs currently include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the English Channel, and the area up to 200 nautical miles off the North American coast plus a zone in the Caribbean. From January 1st, 2020, bunker fuels used globally outside the SECA regions will be restricted to having a maximum sulfur content of 0.5%.
* Butadiene	Butadiene is a four-carbon hydrocarbon molecule with two double bonds. Butadiene is produced from the cracking of hydrocarbons, most notably in steam crackers.
* Butane	Also known as: C4, commercial butane, normal butane, nC4 Butane is one of the lightest liquid streams typically produced in a refinery. The butane molecule has four carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen atoms. Butane is typically either blended into gasoline or LPG (in small volumes) or sold directly as a finished product. When blending into gasoline, butane is favored for its high octane but limited by its high vapor pressure. Because of vapor pressure limits, butane blending into gasoline is often completely eliminated in warmer months of the year, resulting in a seasonal glut of butane. As a commercial finished product, butane is used as a home heating fuel, as cigarette lighter fluid, as a refrigerant gas, and as a propellant, but all of these require in fairly small volumes. Butane is also frequently converted into isobutane for use as an alkylation feedstock. It is sometimes used as a refinery fuel, but this is typically its lowest-value end use and avoided where possible. Butane production Butane comes from many different process units in the refinery, as well as from outside sources such as natural gas plants (from separating NGLs) and from steam crackers (in the C4 raffinate). Major sources of butane inside the refinery include: Atmospheric distillation - All crude oil grades yield some amount of butane when distilled. Typically, butane leaves the distillation tower in a wet gas stream that is sent to the saturated gas plant for separation from lighter gases (methane and ethane) that are then used for fuel FCC - In the FCC conversion process, large amounts of C4s are produced, including both saturated butane and unsaturated butylene. Often the unsaturated olefins are separated for use as feed to the alkylation unit Coker - Similar to the FCC, the coker conversion process generates mixed C4s containing saturated and unsaturated molecules. However, it is less common for coker C4s to have their olefins separated out as the percentage of unsaturated molecules is lower than from the FCC Reformer - Reformers will yield approximately 5% (by volume) of C4s in the conversion process Butane (commercial) product quality Commercial butane typically has the following specifications: Vapor pressure: 31 psig at 70F; 59 psig at 100F; 97 psig at 130F Specific gravity: 0.582 at 60F Initial boiling point: 15F at 1 bar Dew point: 24F at 1 bar Specific heat: 0.549 Btu/lb at 60F; 2.299 kJ/kg at 15.6C Lower limit of flammability: 1.9 vol% gas in air Upper limit of flammability: 8.6 vol% gas in air Latent heat of vaporization: 155 Btu/lb; 383.8 kJ/kg Gross heating value (liquid): 21,170 Btu/lb; 49,241 kJ/kg Gross heating value (gas): 3,350 Btu/ft3; 12,482 kJ/m3
* Butylene	Also known as: butene, C4= Butylene is an unsaturated four-carbon olefin, basically butane with one double bond. In a refinery, butylene is important as a feedstock to the alky unit to make C4 Alkylate, the highest-value alkylate. Butylene is also used to make MTBE and isooctene, which are both high-quality gasoline blendstocks. Refinery butylene primarily comes from the FCC unit. Small amounts of butylene are also produced by other cracking units, such as the visbreaker, but these are less likely to be separated for use in the alky. Butylene can also be sourced externally from steam crackers, which produce a large amount of butylene when processing light naphtha as a feedstock to make ethylene. In the absence of an alky unit, the typical disposition of butylene is in LPG blending or fuel gas, both very low-value options.
* BWAVE	Also known as: Brent weighted average BWAVE is the weighted average price of all trades of Brent crude oil across an entire day.

============ C ============
* C4 Isomerization	The purpose of the C4 isomerization unit is to convert normal butane (n-C4) into isobutane to feed the alkylation unit. Isobutane is produced in a variety of conversion units in a refinery. However, when a refinery has an alkylation unit, there is usually a need to make additional isobutane "on purpose" to keep the alky full. This is done by isomerizing normal butane in a C4 isomerization unit. How it works A normal butane feed stream is mixed with a small amount of hydrogen, raised to 200-400F (93-204C), and injected into a reactor vessel containing a platinum catalyst. The catalyst and heat convert the C4 molecules into the isomer isobutane. Typically, unreacted C4s are recycled to increase yield.
* CAFE	Also known as: Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE is the motor vehicle fuel efficiency standard used in the US. The CAFE standard sets an average fuel efficiency (in miles/gallon) that US automobile manufacturers must achieve on average across the fleet of new cars and light trucks that each of them sell in a given year. The CAFE standards are set and enforced by the EPA.
* Calcineable coke	Calcineable coke is pet coke of a quality that makes it desirable as feed to a calciner to produce calcined coke. To be calcineable, pet coke must be low in metals and sulfur and have a fairly uniform physical consistency.
* Calcined coke	Calcined coke is pet coke that has been processed in a rotary kiln calciner to remove volatiles and make it suitable for forming anodes.
* Calciner	A calciner removes volatile hydrocarbons from pet coke by heating it in a rotary kiln. The resulting calcined coke can then be used to form anodes for the steel and aluminum industries. Some refineries have calciners on site, but most calciners are stand-alone plants that take pet coke from multiple refineries.
* Calendar day	Calendar day capacity is a measure of refinery capacity, adjusting for typical operating conditions that keep average throughput below the maximum achievable throughput for a single day (stream day capacity). Calendar day capacity is the typical capacity measure used in evaluating the economics of a process unit. The relationship between calendar days and stream days is unique to every unit, but a typical rule of thumb is 350 calendar days of operation out of 365 total (stream) days.
* Call on OPEC capacity	Call on OPEC capacity is an estimate of the crude oil production volume required of OPEC countries to balance the global supply and demand for crude oil. The concept is premised on the idea that other sources of crude oil typically run at full capacity and OPEC plays the market-balancing role to match total supply with total demand.
* Call option	A call option is a forward contract that allows the buyer to purchase a commodity in the future at a designated price, in exchange for paying a premium. A call option is essentially a bet that the actual market price in the future will be above the designated price (plus the cost of the premium).

* Capacity	The capacity of a refinery or process unit is a measure of its maximum throughput. In refining, capacity is typically measured in terms of the volume of the primary liquid feed that goes into the unit, though there are some exceptions (such as alkylation) where product output is the more common measure. A given refinery or unit will typically have a number of potentially different measures of its capacity: Design capacity (name plate) - The capacity that the unit was originally designed for, which can be higher or lower than actual maximum capacity under real operating conditions Stream day capacity - Maximum throughput for a single day of operation Calendar day capacity - Maximum sustainable throughput over an extended period of time, recognizing the need for some downtime Mechanical availability - Maximum throughput given the mechanical capability of the hardware at a moment in time Operational availability - Maximum throughput factoring in unit availability and other operational limits on throughput Capacity for a refinery as a whole is typically defined by the volume of crude oil it can process into atmospheric distillation. Refinery sizes range from a few thousand barrels/day up to 1.2 million barrels/day, but most refineries are in the range of 100-250 thousand barrels/day. At this size a refinery is able to capture most of the benefits that come with scale without exceeding the demand for product in its local market (as long as it is near a large city). 
* Capital employed	The capital employed refers to all of the capital tied up in owning and running the refinery. Refining is a very capital-intensive business, so the difference between good and bad management of capital employed can mean the difference between earning returns on capital above or below the cost of capital. The main categories of capital employed in refining are: Plant and equipment (PP&E) – This is the capital tied up in the actual hardware and infrastructure in the refinery, including all processing units, tanks and supporting utilities, road, docks, buildings, etc. Typically, this value is set based on either the capital spent directly on building and upgrading the plant (less depreciation), or the capital invested in buying the plant from another party (less depreciation) Hydrocarbon inventory – This is the value of the crude oil, intermediates, and finished products held in tanks at the refinery on average over time. A refinery will hold inventories of both crude and products for periods ranging from several days to several weeks-worth of operation. Valued at market prices, these inventories can easily equal or exceed the amount of capital in PP&E. The amount of inventory a refiner holds will be affected by a number of factors including: refinery size, number and variety of crude grades run, number and variety of products/grades made, shipping constraints (delivery timing and sizes), individual tank capacities, and “heels” Equipment inventory – A refinery will typically maintain warehouses of equipment that is frequently replaced as part of day-to-day operations and maintenance. How much equipment inventory is held will depend on factors such as: refinery size, refinery complexity, length of equipment supply chain
* Capline	Capline is a major crude oil pipeline running from the US Gulf Coast to the US Midwest.
* CARB	Also known as: California Air Resource Board CARB is the government agency that regulates air quality in the state of California in the US. From a refining standpoint, CARB is important because it regulates the quality of fuels such as gasoline and diesel when sold in California. The standards set by CARB for fuels are generally tighter than in the rest of the US, resulting in a unique set of fuels grades in California called CARB fuels. These include CARB gasoline (CARBOB) and CARB diesel.
* CARB diesel	CARB diesel is the specific grade of diesel fuel required in the state of California in the US. CARB diesel specifications are set by CARB (California Air Resources Board), the state agency that regulates motor fuel quality in California. CARB diesel has a tighter specification than the ULSD used in other parts of the US.
* CARBOB	Also known as: CARB gasoline CARBOB is the standard grade of gasoline supplied to the California market. CARB (California Air Resources Board) is the state regulatory agency that sets the quality standards for gasoline in California. CARB gasoline is supplied as a BOB (before oxygenate blending) grade because it is blended with 10% ethanol before distribution to retail stations. The specifications for CARBOB have been set tighter than for the rest of the US to address the particularly acute air quality situation in California.
* Carbon black	Also known as: Furnace black Carbon black is a specialty product, mad up of solid carbon in a fine powder form. Carbon black from petroleum is typically produced by thermal decomposition and partial combustion of highly aromatic resid material, especially FCC slurry and pitch from a steam cracker. The major uses for carbon black are as a filler in rubber (tire) production and as a pigment (black) in inks and paints. For a refiner, carbon black production is a route to increasing the value of FCC slurry which is otherwise a very low-value product, usually blended into residual fuel oil. Few refiners have on-site carbon black plants. Most are stand-alone, third-party plants that source FCC slurry from multiple refineries.
* Carbon rejection	Carbon rejection refers to any chemical process that results in the production of elemental carbon (such as pet coke) and therefore a reduction in carbon content (rejection) in the liquid hydrocarbons involved. Carbon rejection is common in most cracking processes in refining, such as the FCC, RCC, and coker where excess hydrogen is not available to bond with the carbon atoms separated in the cracking process. Carbon rejection is much smaller in hydrocracking processes, which gives them an advantage in overall liquid product yield.
* Carbon residue	Also known as: concarbon, CCR, Conradson carbon residue, RCR, Ramsbottom carbon residue Carbon residue is a measure of the amount of coke residue left when a hydrocarbon stream is completely distilled. CCR is used as an indicator of the asphaltene content of a stream and a predictor of the coke yield when the stream is fed to a coker or FCC. The two common measures of carbon residue are Ramsbottom (RCR) and Conradson carbon (CCR). Both have units of weight %. In general, a lower carbon residue is more desirable in a crude grade.
* Cargo	A cargo is a waterborne shipment of crude oil or refined product, typically on a tanker. 
* Catalyst	A catalyst is a substance that enhances a chemical reaction without being one of the reactants. Most refining conversion units employ some type of catalyst to expedite the chemical reactions taking place. Common catalysts used in refining include: Hydrofluoric acid - Alkylation Platinum - C4 isomerization Sulfuric acid - Alkylation
* CBOB	CBOB is a common grade of gasoline produced by refiners in the US. It gets its name from being a conventional grade of gasoline ("C") as opposed to a reformulated grade (such as RBOB) that has tighter environmental specifications. CBOB is a "BOB" (before oxygenate blending) because it is formulated for subsequent blending with 10% ethanol to form the final gasoline blend that is marketed to end users.
* Centistokes	Centistoke is the unit of measure of a crude oil or refined product's viscosity.
* Cetane	Also known as: Cetane number, Cetane index Cetane is one of the most important product qualities for diesel. Specifically, cetane is a measure of the tendency of diesel fuel to auto-ignite when injected into the combustion chamber of a diesel engine that has been heated by compression of the air in the chamber. In a diesel engine, air is compressed in the engine's combustion chamber in the absence of any fuel, resulting in very hot compressed air. Fuel is then injected, using the heat of the compressed air to trigger combustion. For efficient engine operation, it is important that the fuel ignites quickly and uniformly when injected. Some hydrocarbons will have a tendency to auto-ignite easily while others will resist ignition. Cetane is a measure of a hydrocarbons ability to readily ignite. So in diesel, a higher cetane number is more desirable. Cetane is valuable to refiners as it allows them to make higher-valued grades of diesel and/or to blend cheap low-cetane material into finished diesel and still meet the cetane specification. The refiner's options for increasing cetane are through hydroprocessing (hydrocracking, hydrotreating) or using cetane enhancers. Measurement of cetane number Cetane number is measured using a scale reflecting the degree to which a fuel will auto-ignite under specific operating conditions. The scale is defined based on the auto-ignition characteristics of two reference fuels. Cetane (C16H36) auto-ignites quite readily and is assigned a cetane rating of 100. Heptamethylnonane (C16H34) has a much lower tendency to auto-ignite and is assigned a rating of 15. Other fuels are assigned a cetane rating based on the mixture of cetane and alpha-methyl-naphthalene that results in the same level of auto-ignition as the fuel being considered. For example, a fuel that auto-ignites like a mixture of 55% cetane mixed with 45% alpha-methyl-naphthalene would have a cetane number of 55. Cetane index Cetane index is an estimation of the cetane number made using bulk properties (density and distillation profile) without having to employ a test engine. Since cetane index cannot account for the presence of cetane improvers, its value is always equal to or less than the true cetane number. High and low cetane materials Certain chemical structures are associated with high and low cetane numbers. Generally speaking, aromatics, olefins, and iso-paraffins (branched paraffins) will have lower cetane numbers. Straight-chain saturated paraffins will have higher cetane numbers and therefore make very good blendstocks for diesel. Some of the higher cetane diesel blendstocks are: Straight run distillate and kerosene - Straight chain, saturated paraffins Hydrotreated distillates - Saturated paraffins Hydrocracked distillate and kerosene - Saturated paraffins The most common lower-cetane diesel-range blendstocks are cycle oil from the FCC and coker gasoil, both of which tend to have a high concentration of aromatics and need to be processed through a diesel hydrotreater before they can be blended into diesel.
* Cetane improvers	Cetane improvers are additives to diesel fuel that, when added at low concentrations, boost the cetane number of the blend. The most common cetane improver is Octyl Nitrate (EHN or 2-Ethylhexyl nitrate). EHN decomposes rapidly in the high temperatures of the combustion chamber, yielding products that help initiate combustion and shorten the ignition delay period. EHN is typically added in the concentration range of 0.05-0.4 mass percent. The effect on cetane increases with a higher cetane base blend. Typical improvement is 3-10 cetane numbers. A drawback of EHN is that it can decrease thermal stability, requiring the use of a stability additive. DTBP (di-tert butyl peroxide) is another cetane improver. It is used less frequently than EHN as it is less effective at increasing cetane number. However, it has the advantage of not contributing to degradation of thermal stability.
* Characterization factor	Also known as: K factor, Watson factor, Kw, UOP characterization factor The characterization factor is a measure of the aromaticity/paraffinicity of a crude oil or of a crude oil fraction. The Watson K factor will range from less than 10 for highly aromatic hydrocarbons and almost 15 for highly paraffinic hydrocarbons. The range for whole crudes is 10.5 to 12.9. 
* CIF	Also known as: Cost, Insurance, and Freight CIF is term used to indicate pricing of a cargo of crude or refined product on a delivered basis, which would include the cost of the oil at the origin plus the cost of insurance and freight to deliver the oil to its destination. For a CIF sale, title to the oil passes to the buyer as the oil passes the discharge flange of the unloading ship. This is in contrast with FOB pricing, which prices the oil just at its cost at origination.
* Clean product tanker	A clean product tanker is a tanker that is dedicated to moving finished petroleum products so as to maintain their quality. This is in contrast to a dirty tanker that moves crude oil and fuel oil with less concern about maintaining tight quality levels. A clean product tanker will typically carry product in multiple tanks, allowing multiple products and product grades to be moved simultaneously while maintaining product segregation.
* Clear gasoline	Clear gasoline is a finished gasoline blend that does not contain ethanol.
* Cloud point	Cloud point is an important quality specification for diesel fuels. This is an indicator of the tendency of a fuel to form wax crystals when cold. These crystals can clog the atomizer that injects fuel into the combustion chamber of a diesel engine. Cloud point is measured as the temperature at which long-chained paraffins begin to crystallize, causing the fuel to turn cloudy. Cloud point specifications are a maximum temperature. A material with lower cloud point is more desirable. In general, low-density (lower boiling point) material will have a lower (more desirable) cloud point.
* Coke drum	The coke drum is the vessel in the coker facility where pet coke accumulates as the cracking reaction occurs. Cokers have multiple drums that are filled sequentially in a semi-batch process. When a drum is full, it is taken out of service, cooled, and emptied of coke. The size and number of coke drums is a key determinant of a coker's capacity.
* Coke pile	The coke pile is the inventory of pet coke held at a refinery that builds up as coke is removed from the coke drums at the coker. This may literally be an open pile of coke, but increasingly coke is placed under a storage dome to limit the pollution caused when wind carries away coke particles.
* Coker	Also known as: delayed coker, DCU In a refinery, the coker is the most extreme of the bottoms upgrading process units. A coker takes the lowest value bottoms material (vacuum resid) and cracks it to the point that all of the resid is eliminated, yielding only lighter fractions and solid carbon (pet coke). The major contribution from the coker is that it allows a refiner to eliminate most or all of the low-value bottoms from crude oil to achieve higher yield of lighter products. This in turn allows the refiner to process cheaper heavy crudes that have a high proportion of resid material, and still achieve high yield of valuable light products. How it works Most cokers are delayed cokers. This is purely a thermal process (non catalyst), using heat to cause the heavy feedstock to crack into a range of lighter components as well as a significant amount of petroleum coke (solid carbon). The mixture of converted material flows into large drums, where the solid coke is allowed to settle and the lighter liquid/vapor is drawn off and sent to a fractionator for separation of the liquid products. When a drum fills with coke, feed is switched to another drum. The full drum is cooled with water, then opened so that the solid coke can be drilled out using high-pressure water jets. Variations on the delayed coking process are the flexicoker and the fluid coker. A flexicoker includes a coke gasifier that continuously converts the pet coke into a fuel gas, avoiding the need to accumulate coke in a drum and creating a significant source of (low Btu) fuel for the refinery. The fluid coker is a scaled-back flexicoker that gasifies only enough coke to provide fuel for the coker itself. Inputs The inputs to the coker are heavy resid material from the vacuum unit and some conversion units. Typical feeds include: Vacuum resid - This bottoms fraction from the vacuum tower makes up most of the feed to the coker FCC slurry - This bottoms material from the FCC is sometimes fed to the coker if there is no higher value use for it in fuel oil blending Products The major products of the coker are largely feedstocks to other refinery process units. These are: Coker naphtha - A heavy naphtha range material that is fed to the reformer, usually via a naphtha hydrotreater to saturate the high level of olefins in coker naptha Coker distillate - A cracked diesel range material that must go through a hydrotreater before blending into finished diesel Coker gasoil - VGO type material that is fed to the the cracking units (FCC and/or the hydrocracker) Pet coke - Essentially a byproduct from the coker. This solid carbon is typically sold as a fuel for power plants and cement plants Cracked gas - Gases from the coker contain a mixture of C1 to C4 material (including unsaturated olefins) as well as hydrogen (H2) and CO2. Coker gas is typically sent to the unsaturated gas plant for separation
* Coker distillate	Coker distillate is diesel range material produced by the coker. As cracked material with high olefins content, it tends to have poor diesel properties (low cetane and high sulfur), so it is typically sent to a hydrotreater or hydrocracker for further upgrading.
* Coker gasoil	Coker gasoil is a VGO range material produced by the coker. It is typically fed into either the FCC or the hydrocracker. It is a cracked product that is often high in olefins and sulfur, making it a lower value cracking feed.
* Coker naphtha	Coker naphtha is a naphtha range product from the coker unit. Coker naphtha is typically hydrotreated to saturate the relatively high level of olefins and then fed to the reformer for upgrading to reformate.
* Colonial pipeline	The Colonial pipeline is one of the major refined product pipelines that moves gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from the US Gulf Coast to the US East Coast market. Colonial plays an important role in both supplying the US East Coast and allowing Gulf Coast refiners to place their production competitively. Most Gulf Coast refiners place at least some of their product on the Colonial pipeline, or sell to customers who do. Due to the volume of refined product moved, the pipeline (especially at its Houston origin) is a major point for spot market trading of these products, providing the basis for the Gulf Coast Pipe price assessment. Description The Colonial pipeline consists of 4 main lines and a number of branch lines. Line 1 - A 40 inch line moving 1.5 million barrels/day of gasoline from Houston to Greensboro, NC Line 2 - A 36 inch line moving 1.2 million barrels/day of middle distillates (diesel, heating oil, jet fuel) from Houston to Greensboro, NC Line 3 - An 885 thousand barrels/day line moving all products (gasoline, diesel, heating oil, jet fuel) from Greensboro, NC to Linden, NJ Line 4 - A 32 inch line moving 700 thousand barrels/day from Greensboro, NC to Baltimore Major spurs off the main lines include: Atlanta to Southern Georgia Atlanta to Tennessee (Chattanooga, Nashville, Knoxville) Greensboro to Raleigh/Durham, NC Mitchell (central Virginia) to Richmond, Norfolk, and Roanoke Colonial connects to a number of other pipelines that move product on through the Northeast, including: Laurel pipeline (Buckeye) - Connects in Philadelphia and moves product west through Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh IHT - Connects in Linden and moves product across the surrounding New York and New Jersey area Long Island pipeline (Buckeye) - Connects in Linden and moves product across Long Island Buckeye East System - Connects in Linden and moves product west to Eastern Pennsylvania, where there is a connection to the Laurel pipeline and lines moving north into Northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York Colonial batches can be either fungible between shippers (with standard specifications set by Colonial) or segregated for a specific shipper. Lines 1 and 2 have a minimum batch size of 75 thousand barrels, while lines 3 and 4 have a minimum of 25 thousand barrels. Colonial schedules batches in 5-day cycles (72 each year). The mix of products and grades in each cycle will vary with changes in market demand. The pipeline is frequently operating at capacity requiring Colonial to allocate space to shippers. Allocated volumes for shippers with an established history (regular shippers) are based on historical shipped volumes. 5% of space is allocated to all new shippers (without necessary shipping history to be regular shippers), which is then assigned to individual shippers by lottery. There is an active market for trading shipping space on the line. Colonial was originally founded by nine oil companies: Sinclair, Texaco, Gulf Oil, American Oil, Pure Oil, Phillips Petroleum, Cities Services, Continental Oil, and Mobil Currently, Colonial is owned by six companies: Koch Industries (28.09%) South Korea National Pension Service and KKR through Keats Pipeline Investors (23.44%) Caisse de depot et placement de Quebec (CDPQ) (16.55%) Shell Pipeline (16.12%) Industry Funds Management (15.80%) History 1961 - Suwannee Pipe Line company created by eight major oil companies for the purpose of building a refined products pipeline from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast 1962 - Project renamed Colonial pipeline and the construction began with the addition of Mobil as the ninth owner 1964 - Pipeline fully operational 1967 - Major expansion to 1 million barrels/day 1972 - Looping project increased capacity to 1.6 million barrels/day Tim Fitzgibbon (12/2018)
* Commercial performance	Commercial performance of a refinery is the effectiveness of sourcing crude and selling refined products. Good performance entails getting the optimal crude at the lowest possible price and selling the optimal product slate at the highest possible price. The prices for crude and products that a refiner faces are largely driven by market conditions (as reflected by the spot market indexes) that are out of the refiner’s control. However, the refiner typically does have some influence on the price paid/received relative to the market index through effective negotiation of individual trades and contracts. Good commercial performance typically requires excellence in the following areas: Identifying available crudes and intermediates for purchase Estimating volumes of product that can be sold – Minimums and maximums, by type, quality and channel Forecasting crude and product prices Executing crude and product trades Arranging optimal crude delivery Executing product and intermediate sales – Spot and term, bulk and rack
* Common carrier	Common carrier refers to any pipeline that offers transportation services to any third party under a standard set of terms. This is in contrast to a private or proprietary pipeline that is either used by the owner for internal purposes or contracted to only a limited set of users.
* Complexity	Complexity is a quantitative measure of how much high-value conversion capacity a refinery has installed relative to its distillation capacity. A complex refinery is one with a large number of high-value conversion units. A low-complexity refinery has fewer and less value-adding units. The complexity number for a refinery is an attempt to summarize a refinery’s configuration in a single measure. This is done by assigning a complexity factor to each type of process unit, and then weight averaging these values based on each unit's capacity relative to the size of distillation capacity at the refinery. The complexity values assigned to each type of process unit range from 1 to 20. They are meant to roughly reflect the relative capital cost of the different units, but they are also assumed to correlate with relative operating costs and margin contribution. There are a number of different complexity number calculations employing basically the same methodology. The most widely known in the industry is the Nelson complexity number. The complexity number has a number of important uses: Comparing refinery configurations – The complexity number provides a useful single measure for comparing multiple refineries with different configurations. A refinery with a higher complexity number can be assumed (all else being equal) to have higher yields of light products per barrel of crude processed, higher margins, a higher asset value, and a higher construction cost Normalizing cost measures – Operating costs are generally thought to correlate with complexity, so the complexity number provides a useful normalization factor when benchmarking refinery cost performance Normalizing asset value –A refinery’s market value (when bought or sold) is generally thought to correlate with complexity number, since complexity correlates roughly with both costs and margins. In this case, the complexity number provides a useful normalization factor when comparing refinery transaction values
* Complexity factors	Typical complexity factors for the major process units in a refinery: Unit Factor Atmospheric distillation 1.0 Vacuum distillation 2.0 Vacuum flash 1.0 Thermal cracking 3.0 Visbreaking 2.0 Coking 5.5 Calcining 108 Asphalt 1.5 Lubes 60.0 FCC (50% conversion) 5.0 FCC (60% conversion) 6.0 Hydrocracking 6.0 Reforming 5.0 Isomerization 3.0 Alkylation 11.0 Polymerization 9.0 Oxygenates 10.0 Aromatics 20.0 Hydrorefining 3.0 Hydrotreating 1.7 Hydrogen production (MCFD) 1.0 Hydrogen recovery (MCFD) 1.0 Sulfur (Ton/day) 85.0 
* Complexity number	The complexity number for a refinery is a measure of the capital intensity of a refinery due the different process units that it contains. It is frequently used to normalize for differences in refinery configuration when comparing different refineries. How complexity number is calculated The complexity number for a refinery is calculated by multiplying the complexity factor for each process unit by the ratio of the process unit's capacity to the refinery's atmospheric distillation capacity, and then summing across all process units. This results in a number that typically falls between 5 and 15. All refinery process units have a complexity factor assigned to them. These factors reflect the capital cost of building each process unit (per barrel/day of capacity) relative to the cost for atmospheric distillation. For example, a coker has a complexity factor of 5.5, because it typically costs 5.5 times as much per barrel of capacity to build as an atmospheric crude tower.
* Compression ratio	Compression ratio is a measure of the change in volume of a combustion chamber in an internal combustion engine across the combustion cycle. The ratio is measured as maximum volume divided by minimum volume. A higher ratio leads to more energy efficiency. However, in a gasoline engine, it also increases the tendency to knock, requiring higher octane gasoline.
* Condensate	Also known as: Lease condensate Condensate is a mixture of light liquid hydrocarbons, similar to a very light (high API) crude oil. It is typically separated out of a natural gas stream at the point of production (field separation) when the temperature and pressure of the gas is dropped to atmospheric conditions. Condensate is mostly composed of NGLs and naphtha range material, and has an API from 45 to 70+. Once separated from natural gas, condensate is generally treated like a crude oil. It can be blended with other heavier crude streams or sent to market directly by pipeline or tanker. Condensate can be processed in a refinery if blended with more conventional crude. Alternatively, it can be sent directly to a condensate splitter for separation into its components. Condensate is typically valued lower than crude oil because of its high light ends content, which yields a lot of lower value LPGs and light naphtha and makes it difficult to process in high volumes in a refinery. However, there are some condensates containing up to 40% of jet fuel and diesel that are priced higher than crude oil, as they contain very little residue material. Condensate is not the same as plant condensate (natural gasoline), which is a product from a gas processing plant. 
* Condensate splitter	A condensate splitter is a simple atmospheric distillation tower designed specifically to process condensate.
* Configuration	Refineries are made up of a number of different process units. The combination of process units that the refinery has is its configuration. The more units a refinery has, the better its ability to run lower-quality (cheaper) crude grades, and to make a high proportion of light (higher-value) products such as diesel and gasoline. Typically the configuration is described in terms of the most value-creating process unit at the refinery. For example, a refinery with a coker and a hydrocracker would likely be described as having a coking/hydrocracking configuration. Some examples of common configuration definitions: Topping configuration - Atmospheric distillation and hydrotreating Hydroskimming configuration - Atmospheric distillation with reforming and hydrotreating Cracking configuration - Atmospheric distillation with FCC, reforming, and hydrotreating A quantitative measure of a refinery’s configuration is its complexity number. A complex refinery has a complexity number of 12-15. A simple refinery has a complexity number below 8.
* Constraint	In refining, a constraint refers to some physical limitation on the process such as a capacity limit, quality limit, or operating condition limit (temperature, pressure). Typically, process engineers are constantly identifying process constraints and looking for ways to overcome them through de-bottlenecking. In addition to the direct physical constraints in the plant hardware, there are also constraints in the models of the the refinery such as the LP and scheduling model. Often these constraints are attempts to simplify or aggregate the representation of real physical constraints. However, on occasion, modeled constraints deviate from reality. These are called false constraints and are essentially errors in the models' representation of the plant.
* Contango	Contango is a market condition where prices of a commodity in the future are higher than current (prompt) prices. When a market is in steep contango (very high future prices), it creates an incentive to build inventories. Contango is the opposite market condition to Backwardation.
* Continuous process	A continuous process is one in which processing happens without interruption, as opposed to batch processing. Most refining processes are continuous (not batch) processes. An important exception is a delayed coker, where the thermal reaction is continuous, but the accumulation of coke in the coke drums is a batch process requiring the drums to be taken out of service to be emptied.
* Control room	A control room is a room in the refinery where operators can monitor and control operations in the plant.
* Conversion processes	Conversion process units are used to convert one hydrocarbon stream into another by changing molecule size and structure. The objective is to shift the yield of the refinery away from less valuable products (e.g., residual fuel oil, LPG) and toward more valuable ones (e.g., gasoline, diesel). They do this by breaking large molecules into smaller ones (cracking), joining small molecules into larger ones, or changing the shape of molecules without changing overall size. A number of different types of conversion units can be found in refineries. The choice the refiner has made of which ones to have often in their refinery usually depends on the nature of the crude feedstock available and the highest demand (and value) products in their local market: FCC - Cracks VGO to form a mix of lighter products, especially gasoline RCC - Cracks atmospheric resid to form a mix of lighter products, especially gasoline Coker - Cracks vacuum resid to form a mix of lighter products, VGO, and pet coke Hydrocracker - Cracks VGO while injecting hydrogen to form a mix of lighter products, favoring saturated hydrocarbon products, such as diesel Resid hydrocracker - Cracks vacuum resid while injecting hydrogen to form a mix of lighter products, also favoring diesel Reformer - Changes the molecular structure of heavy naphtha through creating more aromatics, naphthenic rings, and isomers to raise octane for blending into gasoline Alkylation - Combines a light olefin (butylene, propylene) with isobutane to form a high-quality gasoline blendstock Dimer or poly - Combines two light olefins to form a high-quality gasoline blendstock C4 isomerization - Changes the molecular structure of butane to make isobutane C5/C6 isomerization - Changes the molecular structure of light naphtha to increase the isomers and raise its octane for gasoline blending Visbreaker - Cracks vacuum resid to reduce its viscosity for fuel oil blending Thermal cracker - Cracks VGO to form a mix of lighter products and reduce the viscosity of the VGO
* Cooling water	Cooling water is water that is used to lower the temperature of refining streams and processes.
* Copper strip corrosion test	Copper strip corrosion is a measure of a crude or product's tendency to corrode copper, brass, or bronze materials in storage tanks and pipes.
* Co-products	Co-products are different products that are unavoidably produced simultaneously with each other. This is similar to the concept of byproducts. However, a byproduct is used when one of the products is considered of lower value and less desirable. Co-products indicates that the products are of similar value and desirability. Refining is very much a co-product process, as it results in the co-production of a number of high-value products simultaneously, such as gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.
* Cost and Freight	Also known as: C&F, CFR Cost and freight is a standard set of terms for a cargo contract in which the seller pays all shipping costs, except for insurance. This is in contrast to CIF where the seller pays all costs, including insurance.
* Crack spread	Also known as: Crack A crack spread is the difference in price between a refined product (or group of products) and crude oil. It is used as a rough indicator of market conditions, roughly approximating the margin from processing light sweet crude through a cracking configuration refinery. Typically, a crack is defined in terms of one specific product versus one specific crude. For example, the diesel crack on Brent. In this case, it is meant to indicate how much the price of the individual product is contributing to refining profitability. Some more complicated cracks are used to provide a somewhat more accurate indicator of overall refining margin: 3-2-1 crack - Defined as (2 x gasoline price + 1 x diesel price) - (3 x crude price) 6-3-2-1 crack - Defined as (3 x gasoline price + 2 x diesel price + 1 x fuel oil price) - (6 x crude price) 
* Cracked gas plant	In a refinery, the cracked gas plant is the set of units that processes refinery gas coming from cracking units. This is different from the sat gas plant, which handles gas from non-cracking units. Cracked gas is kept separate in order to isolate important components such as butylene and propylene that don't occur in the saturated gas streams.
* Cracking	Cracking is a broad term that refers to any process that results in the breaking down of larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules. Most of the major conversion units in a refinery perform some type of cracking. Cracking can be achieved through the use of heat (thermal cracking) or hydrogen addition (hydrocracking), often in the presence of a catalyst (catalytic cracking/hydrocracking). Cracking in its various forms is the primary means of improving the product yield of a refinery to include more of the high-value light products and less of the low-value heavy products.
* Cracking configuration	Cracking configuration is a medium complexity refining configuration consisting of atmospheric distillation, reforming, hydrotreating, and FCC.
* Creep	Also known as: Capacity creep Creep refers to the tendency of refining capacity to gradually increase over time, even without major capital projects. This largely comes from the continuous, incremental de-bottlenecking of the constraints in individual process units by process engineers in an effort to maximize profitability.
* Crude grades	Crude oil comes in hundreds of different varieties or "grades." These grades are valued differently by refiners based on their crude qualities. Some of the more common crude oil grades that have regular price assessments are: Crude API Sulfur Source Agbami 47.2 0.05 Nigeria Akpo 45.8 0.07 Nigeria Al Shaeen 30.3 1.90 Qatar Amenam 37.0 0.17 Nigeria Amna 37.0 0.17 Libya ANS 31.4 0.96 US Arab Extra Light 40.0 1.09 Saudi Arabia Arab Heavy 28.0 2.80 Saudi Arabia Arab Light 33.0 1.77 Saudi Arabia Arab Medium 31.0 2.55 Saudi Arabia Arab Super Light 51.0 0.09 Saudi Arabia Ardjuna 37.0 0.09 Indonesia Attaka 43.0 0.09 Indonesia Azeri Light 34.9 0.55 Azerbaijan Bach Ho 39.0 0.04 Vietnam Bakken 42.1 0.18 US Banoco 31.8 2.45 Bahrain Basrah Heavy 23.6 4.20 Iraq Basrah Light 30.0 2.92 Iraq Belida 45.0 0.02 Indonesia Bonga 29.1 0.29 Nigeria Bonito 33.5 1.32 US Bonny Light 34.5 0.14 Nigeria Bow River 24.7 2.10 Canada Brass River 36.5 0.13 Nigeria Brega 42.0 0.22 Libya Brent 37.9 0.45 UK BTC 36.6 0.16 Azerbaijan Cabinda 32.5 0.13 Angola Castilla 18.8 1.97 Colombia Champion 28.0 0.12 Brunei Cinta 32.7 0.12 Indonesia Cold Lake 19.9 3.25 Canada Cossack 48.0 0.04 Australia CPC 46.6 0.55 Kazakhstan Dalia 23.7 0.49 Angola Daqing 32.7 0.10 China Dar 26.4 0.12 Sudan Das 39.2 1.30 UAE Djeno 27.6 0.34 Congo Doba 25.1 0.08 Chad Dubai 31.0 2.04 UAE DUC 33.5 0.25 Denmark Duri 21.5 0.20 Indonesia Eagle Ford 45.0 0.20 US Ekofisk 37.5 0.23 Norway Enfield 22.0 0.12 Australia Erha 33.7 0.18 Nigeria Es Sider 36.2 0.49 Libya Escalante 24.1 0.19 Argentina Escravos 34.0 0.15 Nigeria ESPO 36.0 0.50 Russia Eugene Island 36.0 1.20 US Fateh 30.0 3.00 UAE Flotta 36.9 0.82 UK Forcados 30.0 0.15 Nigeria Forties 40.3 0.56 UK Gippsland 48.0 0.10 Australia Girassol 31.0 0.33 Angola Griffin 55.0 0.03 Australia Gullfaks 36.2 0.26 Norway Handil 33.8 0.07 Indonesia Hibernia 34.6 0.47 Canada HLS 33.5 0.42 US Hungo 27.4 0.65 Angola Iran Heavy 30.7 1.80 Iran Iran Light 33.7 1.50 Iran Isthmus 33.6 1.30 Mexico Jubilee 36.4 0.26 Ghana Kern River 13.0 1.10 Canada Khafji 29.0 2.85 Neutral Zone Kikeh 36.7 0.06 Malaysia Kimanis 38.6 0.06 Malaysia Kirkuk 36.0 2.00 Iraq Kissanje 30.7 0.36 Angola Kole 30.2 0.34 Cameroon Kumkol 41.2 0.11 Kazakhstan Kutubu 45.0 0.04 Papua New Guinea Kuwait 31.0 2.52 Kuwait Labuan 29.9 0.03 Malaysia LHS 42.0 0.45 US Line 63 28.0 1.02 US LLB 20.9 3.46 Canada LLS 38.5 0.39 US Loreto 18.1 1.30 Peru LSB 36.1 1.05 Canada Magdalena 20.0 1.60 Colombia Marlim 19.2 0.78 Brazil Mars 28.0 1.93 US Masila 31.0 0.54 Yemen Maya 22.0 3.30 Mexico MEH 42.0 0.45 US Merey 16.0 2.45 Venezuela Mesa 30.0 0.90 Venezuela Midale 30.0 2.35 Canada Midway Sunset 13.0 1.20 US Minas 35.0 0.08 Indonesia Miri 29.8 0.08 Malaysia MSW 40.5 0.40 Canada Murban 40.4 0.79 UAE Nanhai 39.5 0.05 China Napo 19.0 2.01 Ecuador Nemba 38.7 0.19 Angola Nile Blend 32.8 0.05 Sudan Niobrara 39.0 0.39 US Olmeca 39.3 0.80 Mexico Oman 33.3 1.06 Oman Oriente 24.0 1.40 Ecuador Oseberg 39.6 0.20 Norway Palanca 37.2 0.18 Angola Pazflor 25.6 0.43 Angola Plutonio 33.2 0.37 Angola Poseidon 30.5 1.70 US Pyrenees 19.0 0.21 Australia Qatar Land 41.1 1.22 Qatar Qatar Marine 36.2 1.60 Qatar Qua Iboe 36.6 1.60 Nigeria Rabi 33.2 0.14 Gabon Roncador 33.2 0.14 Gabon Saharan Blend 46.0 0.10 Algeria Sakhalin Blend 44.7 0.16 Russia San Joaquin Light 26.0 1.10 US Santa Barbara 36.0 0.95 Venezuela Sarir 38.0 0.83 Libya Senipah 51.0 0.03 Indonesia Seria Blend 38.0 0.08 Brunei Shengli 24.0 0.90 China Siberian Light 34.8 0.57 Russia Sirtica 41.0 0.40 Libya Sokol 35.6 0.27 Russia Southern Green Canyon 28.5 2.14 US Statfjord 39.1 0.22 Norway Su Tu Den 35.8 0.05 Vietnam Suez Blend 30.4 1.65 Egypt Syncrude 33.0 0.16 Canada Syrian Heavy 23.1 4.19 Syria Syrian Light 38.0 0.68 Syria Tapis 46.0 0.02 Malaysia Tengiz 47.5 0.47 Kazakhstan Terra Nova 33.2 0.48 Canada THUMS 17.0 1.50 US Thunder Horse 31.5 0.96 US Troll 35.9 0.14 Norway Upper Zakum 34.0 1.95 UAE Urals 30.6 1.48 Russia Usan 30.6 0.23 Nigeria Van Gogh 17.0 0.37 Australia Vasconia 24.3 0.83 Colombia Vincent 18.5 0.55 Australia WCS 20.1 3.64 Canada White Cliffs 46.0 0.39 US White Rose 46.0 0.39 Canada Widuri 33.3 0.07 Indonesia Wilmington 17.0 1.20 US WTI 42.0 0.45 US WTS 38.0 0.50 US Wyoming Sweet 32.0 0.90 US Zafiro 29.5 0.26 Equatorial Guinea Zarzaitine 42.8 0.06 Algeria Zuetina 41.5 0.31 Libya
* Crude oil	Also known as: petroleum, crude Crude oil is a naturally occurring mixture of liquid hydrocarbons. In its natural state, crude oil has few direct uses. However, when it is processed through an oil refinery, it can be transformed into a wide variety of highly valued liquid petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel. The value of these products comes from their high energy density and liquid state, which makes them ideal as transportation fuels. Crude oil comes in hundreds of different varieties, called crude grades. As a naturally occurring raw commodity, crude oil from different fields and reservoirs can have very different properties. Crude grades from the same location with similar properties will typically be referred to as a single grade. Examples of some well-known crude grades are Brent, Tapis, and WTI. There are a wide variety of different properties that are used to distinguish between crude grades. These are detailed in a chemical analysis of the crude called a crude assay. The most common characteristics used to identify the quality of a crude are its API gravity and its sulfur content. The highest valued crude grades are typically those with high API gravity and low sulfur content. These are referred to as "light-sweet crudes." At the opposite end of the spectrum are the grades with low API gravity and high sulfur content, which are referred to as "heavy-sour crudes."
* Crude slate	Also known as: Crude diet The crude slate for a refinery is the mix of different crude grades that the refinery is running. It is common for a refinery to have a crude slate including many different crude grades, and for the slate to change over time as market conditions (crude availability and pricing) change and the refinery re-optimizes the slate to maximize profitability. 
* Cryogenic separation	Cryogenic separation is one method used to purify the hydrogen produced by conversion units for subsequent use as a feedstock into hydrocrackers or hydrotreaters.
* Cushing	Cushing is a major crude oil trading, storage, and transportation hub located in Oklahoma in the US. Cushing is important as a point where large volumes of US-produced crude are gathered from across the inland regions of the country. Cushing has a large capacity to blend and store crude, and pipeline connections with most of the major producing and refining centers in the middle part of the US. Cushing has become a major trading point, because of the volume of crude that moves through it and the availability of crude storage and blending facilities. Trading at Cushing serves as the basis for the NYMEX light sweet crude market in spot and derivatives trading.
* Cut point	In fractional distillation, a cut point is the temperature that defines the boundary between two crude oil fractions that are being separated. For the lighter fraction, the cut point represents the end point, or temperature below which all of the light fraction components boil. For the heavier fraction, the cut point represents initial boiling point or temperature above which all of the heavier fraction's components boil. Refiners can adjust the yield of two adjacent fractions by modifying the cut point, and thereby generating more of one fraction and less of the other. The range across which the refiner typically swings the cut point is called the swing cut.
* Cutback asphalt	Cutback asphalt is asphalt that has been diluted to reduce its flow temperature and make it easier to transport and apply. Once mixed with aggregate and laid in place, the diluent evaporates, curing (hardening) the asphalt into place. Different intermediates can be used as diluents depending upon how quickly the asphalt needs to cure (harden): naphtha for a rapid cure, kerosene for a medium cure, and gas oil for a slow cure. 
* Cutter stock	Also known as: Cutter Cutter stock is any stream that is blended to reduce the viscosity of the resulting blend. Cutter stock is commonly used in fuel oil blending. Fuel oil tends to be a sink for high-viscosity resid that must be offset by blending lower-viscosity material to meet the viscosity specification of the fuel oil. Common cutter stocks for fuel oil blending are LCO and kerosene. These cutter stocks are significantly more valuable than the resulting fuel oil blend, so this loss of value translates into a significant cost of meeting the viscosity specification of the fuel oil. Therefore, refiners look for all ways possible to minimize the amount of cutter stock in the finished blend while still producing on-spec fuel oil.
* Cycle (pipeline)	A pipeline cycle is a standard sequence of different batches the pipeline cycles through over a standard period of time. The calendar year is divided into these cycles, numbered in order.
* Cycle oil	Also known as: light cycle oil, LCO Cycle oil is the diesel range product from the FCC unit. As a diesel blendstock, cycle oil is not very highly valued because of its high aromatics content, which gives it a low cetane. Typically, it is hydrotreated to raise its cetane and then blended into diesel.
* Cyclone	In an FCC, the cyclones in the reactor separate the catalyst suspended in the FCC product so the catalyst can be sent to the regenerator section where the coke on it can be burned off. There are also cyclones at the top of the regenerator section in order to separate the regenerated catalyst from the off-gases, CO plus CO2, so that the regenerated catalyst can be returned to the reactor.

============ D ============
* DAO	Also known as: De-asphalted oil DAO is the product of solvent de-asphalting of vacuum resid. Solvent de-asphalting uses propane to extract asphaltenes from vacuum resid, resulting in DAO. The DAO is typically used as feedstock to the FCC or for lubes manufacturing.
* Dated Brent	Dated Brent is a contract for delivery of a physical cargo of Brent (or a substitutable grade) on a given date.
* DDGS	Also known as: Distiller's dried grains with solubles DDGS is the solid byproduct of ethanol production from corn. It is nutrient-rich and used as a feed for livestock. The value that ethanol distillers get for DDGS is an important driver of their overall profitability and therefore the breakeven price at which they will produce ethanol.
* DEA	Also known as: diethanolamine DEA is a common chemical used to extract H2S gas from refinery gas streams in the amine or girbotol unit. The DEA absorbs H2S when it comes into contact with an H2S-rich stream, but leaves other hydrocarbons behind. The H2S-rich DEA is heated to separate a pure H2S stream that can then be sent to the sulfur plant for conversion into elemental sulfur. DEA is not consumed in the process, but it does degrade gradually with repeated use and must be periodically replaced with fresh DEA. MEA (Monoethanolamine) is an alternative to DEA that performs essentially the same way.
* Decoking	Decoking is the process of removing coke that has accumulated in coke drums in the coker unit. This is typically done using a hydraulic (high-pressure water) jet to cut the coke.
* Dehydrogenation	Also known as: Dehydro Dehydrogenation is a reaction process in which hydrogen is removed, typically resulting in the creation of a double bond and therefore an olefin. An example is propane dehydro where propane is converted into propylene (and byproduct hydrogen gas).
* Denatured alcohol	Denatured alcohol is ethyl alcohol (ethanol) that has been mixed with a small amount of denaturing agent (typically methanol) to make it unfit for human consumption.
* Density	Also known as: Gravity Density is the weight of a commodity per unit of volume. Typically, lighter (lower density) crude oils are more valuable.
* Desalter	In a refinery, crude oil containing high levels of salt will go through a desalter before being fed to the atmospheric distillation tower. Removal of salts is important for reducing corrosion in the distillation tower and downstream processing units. If not removed, the salt will form acids when heated that will result in corrosion. Also, the salt can form deposits on heat exchanger surfaces over time, resulting in fouling. Desalting also removes suspended solids such as sand, dirt, and rust particles picked up in transport. How it works In the desalter, the crude oil is heated and then mixed with 5-15% volume of fresh water so that the water can dilute the dissolved salts. The oil-water mix is put into a settling tank to allow the salt-containing water to separate and be drawn off. Frequently, an electric field is used to encourage water separation. Demulsifying chemicals are also used. For high levels of salt and/or to achieve very low final concentrations, two- or three-stage desalting may be used. Typical desalted crude will have concentration of 1 pound/thousand barrels (PTB). 
* Dewatering	Dewatering is the process of removing water from crude oil before it is charged to the atmospheric distillation tower. Typically, this is done by letting the crude rest in a tank, allowing the water and oil to naturally separate, and then pumping out the layer of water from underneath the oil.
* Dewaxing	Dewaxing is the process of removing wax from base oil feedstocks before further processing into lubricants. Dewaxing is done in two ways: selective hydrocracking to crack the wax molecules, and crystallization through refrigeration and dilution of the oil using a light oil solvent.
* Diene	Also known as: Diolefin A diene is a hydrocarbon molecule with two double bonds, for example butadiene.
* Diesel	Diesel is one of the major petroleum products produced from processing crude oil in a petroleum refinery. Diesel is one of the higher-valued light products (along with jet fuel and gasoline). It is used primarily in the transportation sector, and it is the primary fuel used in heavy-duty trucks and locomotives. Also, in some markets, it is used in light-duty cars and trucks. Diesel-range material also has a number of off-road uses, as a fuel for construction and farm equipment and as a heating fuel (home heating oil). However, this is a much smaller share of use than the transport sector uses. Generally, refiners will try to maximize their yield of diesel, along with gasoline, to maximize profit. Since the two products draw from different boiling range material, they are largely complementary. However, there are a few conversion units that favor one over the other, forcing refiners to make a call on which will be more value-creating. Most notably, FCCs will tend to upgrade VGO more toward gasoline, and hydrocrackers will upgrade VGO more toward diesel. Diesel tends to compete with jet fuel for some of the same blendstocks, specifically kerosene, which makes up most of jet fuel and is a good blendstock into diesel. As a result, maximizing jet fuel production can come at the cost of diesel yield, and vice versa. Diesel blending Diesel is typically a complex blend of many different refinery streams. The most common components are: Hydrotreated distillate from the distillate hydrotreater Hydrocracker distillate from the hydrocracker Straight run gasoil from the atmospheric crude tower Hydrotreated kerosene from the kerosene hydrotreater Hydrocracker kerosene from the hydrocracker Straight run kerosene from the atmospheric crude tower Diesel can also include some blendstocks that do not come from refining. These include: Biodiesel - Produced through processing a vegetable oil or animal fat using a transesterification process Renewable diesel - Produced through hydroprocessing a vegetable oil or animal fat GTL diesel - Produced from natural gas using a Fischer-Tropsch process Diesel product qualities Diesel-powered vehicles use diesel cycle engines, which rely on the heat of compression to ignite the fuel. To perform well, this requires diesel to have specific product qualities. Some of the more important ones are: Cetane - Measure of the tendency of diesel fuel to auto-ignite when injected into the combustion chamber of a diesel engine Sulfur content - Measure of the sulfur remaining in the fuel. Lower sulfur is more desirable. Sulfur content is measured as ppm wt Cloud point - Indicator of the tendency of a fuel to form wax crystals when cold. Lower cloud point is more desirable Pour point - Measure of the tendency of a fuel to become more viscous and resist flowing when cold. Lower pour point is more desirable Flash point - Temperature at which a fuel emits enough vapor to form a combustible mixture of hydrocarbon and air. Higher flash point is more desirable
* Dilbit	Dilbit is a crude oil blend made by combining produced bitumen with a diluent such as light naphtha. Dilbit is a common grade of crude produced in the Western Canadian oil sands. The diluent is added to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen to a point where it can be moved by pipeline. The alternative to blending diluent is to upgrade the crude through coking or hydrocracking.
* Diluent	Diluent is any commodity that is blended into extra-heavy crude to reduce its viscosity and allow it to be transported. The most common diluent is condensate. However, any lighter crude or product could be used.
* Dimate	Dimate is a high-octane gasoline blendstock produced in the dimerization unit from propylene.
* Dimerization unit	Also known as: Dimersol, Dimer unit A dimerization unit is a form of polymerization that converts propylene into a gasoline blendstock by joining two propylene molecules to form one C6 olefin called dimate. Dimerization has largely been replaced by alkylation units, which have the advantages of using isobutane as well as propylene (expanding the resulting volume of gasoline) and resulting in a higher-quality product.
* Dirty tanker	A dirty tanker is an oil tanker used to transport crude oil or other black oils such as residual fuel oil. This is in contrast to a clean product tanker that transports finished refined products such as gasoline or diesel.
* Distillate	Also known as: Middle distillate Distillate is a term used to refer both to the atmospheric gasoil cut from atmospheric distillation, and to a range of light products ranging from kerosene to diesel. Generally, the distillate products are considered to include: Kerosene Jet fuel Diesel Heating oil Industrial gasoil (IGO) Marine gasoil (MGO)
* Distillate hydrotreater	The distillate hydrotreater is a category of hydrotreaters that treats distillate streams from atmospheric distillation and from conversion units to reduce their sulfur content and to improve their properties for blending into diesel.
* Distillation curve	A distillation curve is a graph showing the cumulative volume of a crude oil (or other hydrocarbon stream) that boils off at different temperatures. For a crude oil, the distillation curve effectively describes how much of the crude volume falls into the different distillation fractions such as naphtha, kerosene, and atmospheric gas oil.
* Distillation cuts	Also known as: distillation fractions, straight run streams Distillation cuts are the output streams from a distillation tower. They are called "cuts" because they are the result of separating the crude oil into its constituent parts based on the different temperatures at which they evaporate and condense (e.g., cut points). The typical distillation cuts coming from atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation are: Refinery gas - Made up of methane and ethane. This stream remains a gas and is sent to the fuel system Propane - Blended into LPG or used for refinery fuel Butane - Blended into LPG or used as refinery fuel Light straight run naphtha - Sold as a petrochemical feedstock, blended into gasoline, or upgraded through isomerization Heavy naphtha - Mostly upgraded through the reformer Kerosene - Used to make jet fuel or blended into diesel Atmospheric gasoil - Used to make diesel or converted to gasoline through the FCC Atmospheric bottoms - Contains all of the hydrocarbons that do not vaporize. It is typically fed to the vacuum distillation unit for further separation VGO or Vacuum gasoil - Typically sent to the FCC or hydrocracker to be upgraded into light products Vacuum resid - Literally the bottom of the barrel. Typically blended into residual fuel oil or upgraded through a coker or visbreaker
* Distillation profile	Gasoline is a complex mixture of different hydrocarbons with different properties. Consequently, when heated, different components will vaporize at different temperatures. How much gasoline vaporizes at low temperatures (front-end volatility), medium temperatures (mid-range volatility), and high temperatures (tail-end volatility) will affect performance across a wide range of dimensions and is known as the distillation profile of the fuel. The performance affected includes: Front-end volatility (low temperatures): Cold start Hot start Avoiding vapor lock Minimizing evaporative emissions Mid-range volatility (medium temperatures): Achieving quick warm up Fuel efficiency on short trips Good power and acceleration Avoiding carburetor icing Avoiding hot stalling Tail-end volatility (high temperatures): Fuel efficiency after warm up Avoiding engine deposits Minimizing dilution of crankcase oil Minimizing VOC emissions Distillation properties are typically measured as the temperatures of initial boiling, at specific volume percent recovery (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%), and end point or final volume recovery.
* DOE	Also known as: US Department of Energy The DOE is the US federal agency responsible for energy policy. It also houses the EIA.
* Downstream	Downstream refers to the part of the petroleum value chain where crude oil is converted into marketable refined products. Refining is the core part of the downstream, though transportation and marketing are sometimes also included in the definition.
* Draft	Draft is the distance below the water surface that a tanker's hull reaches. Ports, canals, and channels typically have a draft limit that determines which classes of tanker they can accommodate.
* Driveability index	Driveability index is a measure of a gasoline's performance across a number of operating conditions, covering cold start and warmed up operations. It incorporates elements of the distillation profile for the gasoline (temperatures for evaporation percentages, such as T50) as well as ethanol content. The driveability index is calculated as: DI (in degrees C) = 1.5x(T10) + 3.0x(T50) + (T90) + 1.33x(Vol % ethanol) or DI (in degrees F) = 1.5x(T10) + 3.0x(T50) + (T90) + 2.4x(Vol % ethanol) Where T10, T50, and T90 are the temperatures at which 10%, 50%, and 90% of volume boils off, respectively.
* Driving season	Driving season refers to summer in the Northern Hemisphere when demand for gasoline is typically at its seasonal peak.
* Dry gas	Dry gas is natural gas that contains little or no NGLs. This can either occur naturally or result from removal of NGLs from the gas.
* Dubai crude	Dubai is a medium sour crude oil grade, produced in the United Arab Emirates. As one of the few spot traded Middle Eastern grades, it is an important benchmark crude for the market.
* DWT	Also known as: Deadweight ton DWT is a measure of the weight (or displacement) of everything that a ship is carrying. It is equal to the entire displacement (or weight) minus the weight of the ship itself. It includes the cargo plus fuel, supplies, people, ballast, etc. DWT is the measure by which ships are generally categorized by size. DWT provides a rough approximation of the weight of cargo (DWCC) that a ship can carry. This is usually around 95% of DWT.

============ E ============
* E10	E10 is gasoline blended with 10% ethanol by volume to form a finished gasoline. E10 is the most common grade of gasoline in the US and the primary means by which the US refining industry satisfies the renewable blending mandates set by the EPA under the renewable fuels standard. E10 is typically blended at the distribution terminal (rack) just before delivery of fuel to retail stations by truck. E10 is a blend of pure (denatured) ethanol with a BOB such as CBOB or RBOB.
* E15	E15 is gasoline blended with 15% ethanol by volume to form a finished gasoline. E15 is not common but is being promoted as a blend by the EPA in the US to allow compliance with a rising mandate for renewable fuel blending. Currently, the market is dominated by the lower-ethanol E10 grade. 
* E70	E70 is gasoline blended with 70% ethanol by volume to form a finished gasoline. E70 is blended in the US to satisfy the renewable fuels mandate administered by the EPA under the renewable fuels standard. E70 makes up a very small percentage of the US gasoline market, which is dominated by the much lower-ethanol content E10 grade.
* E85	E85 is gasoline blended with 85% ethanol by volume to form a finished gasoline. 
* Ebulated bed	Also known as: expanded bed An ebullated bed reactor has a bed of catalyst that is expanded by vapor and liquid flowing through it. An advantage of this design is that it allows the catalyst to be continuously withdrawn, reactivated, and reinjected or replaced with some fresh catalyst. This maintains catalyst activity over time.
* Economics	The profitability of refineries varies widely, across different individual refineries, as well as over time for a single refinery as market conditions change. Measures of refinery profitability The economic performance of a refinery can be measured in a number of different ways. Typical measures of refinery profitability are: Refinery margins - A measure of the value created per unit of crude oil processed or per barrel of crude distillation capacity Refinery returns - The value created by the refinery per unit of capital invested or employed in the refinery Refinery asset values - The lump sum value of a refinery, typically for a buyer or seller Drivers of profitability There are a number of internal and external factors that have a large effect on refinery profitability. They can be grouped into the following major categories: Oil market conditions (prices) – The pricing conditions for crude oil and refined products that determines the potential margin that a refinery can make processing crude to make finished products Refinery configuration – The design of the refinery (capacity and complexity) that determines which crude grades the refinery can run and what yield of product it can achieve Refinery operating performance – The efficiency and effectiveness of running the refinery Refinery commercial performance – The efficiency and effectiveness of sourcing crude oil (and other feedstocks) and selling products (and intermediates)
* EIA	Also known as: Energy Information Administration The EIA is an agency in the US Department of Energy that is responsible for gathering and publishing data on the US energy sector. This includes detailed monthly data on oil and gas production, processing, movements, and consumption.
* EN590	EN590 is the emissions standard for automotive diesel in Europe set by the European Union.
* Enbridge System	The Enbridge System a major crude oil pipeline system that primarily moves Western Canadian crude into the US Midwest market.
* End point	Also known as: EP The end point for a distillation fraction is the temperature at which 100% of the fraction has evaporated when distilled. This means it is also in theory the cut point between the fraction and the next heavier fraction being distilled, and the initial boiling point of that heavier fraction. However, in reality, the true end point of a fraction is typically higher than the true initial boiling point of the next highest fraction (i.e., they overlap) because they are complex mixtures of different hydrocarbons. Consequently, refiners in practice split the difference and define an "effective" end point that is in between and therefore lower than the true end point.
* Endothermic	Endothermic reactions and processes require the input of energy (heat) for the reaction to take place. Most refinery processes involve endothermic reactions and thus consume energy in the form of refinery fuel, steam, or electricity.
* EPA	Also known as: Environmental Protection Agency The EPA is the government agency in the US responsible for environmental policy and regulation. The EPA sets environmental standards for refined products in the US, administers the renewable fuels mandate, and regulates direct environmental emissions from refineries.
* EPC	Also known as: Engineering, procurement, and construction EPC refers the steps of developing a major capital project and the industry/companies who provide these steps as a service.
* ETBE	Also known as: Ethyl tertiary butyl ether ETBE is an oxygenate used as a gasoline blendstock to add octane. ETBE is manufactured by combining isobutylene with ethanol (often bio-ethanol to get the biofuel credits available in many countries) by heating them together over a catalyst. A number of ETBE process units have been converted from MTBE process units, especially in Europe, as the process is similar (MTBE is based on combining isobutylene with methanol rather than ethanol), but the methanol does not receive biofuel credits.
* Ethane	Also known as: C2 Ethane is a simple hydrocarbon with 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Ethane is a gas at room temperature. It is produced from natural gas wells along with methane and is often left in the natural gas that is sent to market. Separated ethane is a major feedstock to steam crackers for the production of ethylene and its derivatives. In a refinery, ethane is produced as part of the refinery gas generated by many refinery process units and usually left in the gas burned as refinery fuel.
* Ethanol	Also known as: Ethyl alcohol, EtOH, bioethanol Ethanol is a non-refinery based hydrocarbon that is widely used as a gasoline blendstock. Ethanol is blended into gasoline for a variety of business and policy reasons. Ethanol has high octane and can be used as an octane booster. Because ethanol contains oxygen, it can be used to reduce the carbon monoxide emissions from burning gasoline. Also, as a renewable fuel, ethanol blending is mandated in some markets to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Fuel ethanol is typically manufactured by fermenting the sugars in agricultural products such as corn, sugar cane, and beets. When produced this way, it is able to receive biofuel credits in countries with these regulations. In the US, most ethanol is produced through fermentation of corn. In Brazil, sugar cane is the most common feed stock. Ethanol qualities When blended into gasoline, ethanol significantly raises the octane and vapor pressure. However, its impact on both qualities varies widely with the concentration of ethanol in the mix and the chemical properties of the other hydrocarbons in the blend. As a result, ethanol is typically blended into gasoline in fixed ratios (e.g., 10%, 15%). Ethanol-blended gasoline is kept segregated from ethanol-free gasoline. Ethanol has an energy content that is about 70% of typical gasoline. As a result, vehicles using ethanol blended fuels will have lower fuel economy. The price of ethanol blended fuel typically reflects this. Ethanol highly miscible with water. Consequently, ethanol and gasoline/ethanol blends must be kept clear of any water contamination. Otherwise the water (and any contaminants that collect in the water) would form a solution in the fuel and ultimately end up in vehicle engines. To avoid this, ethanol is typically kept separate from gasoline until loaded into a tank truck for final delivery. This means ethanol can not be distributed through the pipeline systems that move large volumes of gasoline in most countries. Ethanol shipments are primarily by (more expensive) truck, rail or barges.
* Ethylene	Ethylene is an olefin with two carbon atoms. Ethylene is the primary product of steam crackers and the basic building block for many plastics. In a refinery, ethylene is produced in the refinery gas generated by many cracking units, but it is usually left in the refinery gas used as refinery fuel.

* Exothermic	Exothermic reactions or processes emit energy (heat) during reactions, making them net generators of energy. Alkylation is an example of one of the few exothermic refining processes.
* Explorer pipeline	The Explorer pipeline is one of the major refined product pipelines that moves gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from the US Gulf Coast to the US Midwest market. Historically Explorer has been an important source of supply for the Midwest region, but as local refining production in the Midwest has increased the need for movements on Explorer has declined. Due to the volume of product moved, the pipeline (especially at its Houston origin) is a major point for spot trading of these products, providing the Gulf Coast Pipe price assessment. Description Explorer is a major refined products pipeline running from the refining centers around Houston and Port Arthur, Texas north to Midwest markets including Dallas, Tulsa, St. Louis, and Chicago. Explorer is comprised of several segments: Port Arthur to Tulsa - 28" line Houston to Arlington (Dallas) - 10" line Tulsa to Chicago - 24" line The southern segments (to Tulsa and Arlington) have a combined capacity of 660 thousand barrels/day. The northern segment has a capacity of 450 thousand barrels/day. The current owners of Explorer are Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum, Sunoco Logistics, and Shell. History Explorer was originally owned and built by eight oil companies: Apco Oil, Cities Services, Continental Oil, Gulf Oil, Phillips Petroleum, Shell, Sun Oil, and Texaco Operations on the line began in 1972.

* Export netback	Also known as: netback pricing Export netback is a common price-setting mechanism in which the price of a commodity is set in one place based on the value of the commodity in the market it is being sent to, minus the cost to move it to that market. Export netback pricing can occur naturally through market dynamics, or it can be established directly through contract terms.

============ F ============
* FAME	Also known as: Fatty acid methyl esters FAME is the most common form of biodiesel used for blending into diesel fuel. FAME is produced by transesterifaction of oil (usually vegetable oil) with methanol.
* Fat oil	In an absorption process, fat oil is the output oil containing the absorbing oil and the component being absorbed.
* FCC	Also known as: fluid catalytic cracker, cat cracker, cat unit, FCCU, CCU, Houdry In refining, the FCC is the most common unit used to upgrade heavier distillation cuts to light products. The FCC takes VGO and similar intermediate streams and cracks them using heat in the presence of a catalyst. The primary product is FCC gasoline, which is used in gasoline product blending. However, the FCC also produces lighter products that feed the alkylation unit and heavier products that can be blended into diesel and residual fuel oil. The FCC is particularly valuable in a refinery that is trying to maximize gasoline production over residual fuel oil. The FCC yields a high volume of gasoline of pretty good quality (high octane and low vapor pressure). However, its volume yield of diesel is low and of low quality (low cetane), since it is made up of cracked material which tends to have low cetane. In a market where diesel is preferred over gasoline, an FCC is generally less valuable than a hydrocracker. Often, to achieve a high yield of light products with a balance between gasoline and diesel, a refinery will have both an FCC and a hydrocracker. In this case, the two units can be highly complementary, with the FCC taking the unconverted feed from the hydrocracker and the hydrocracker taking the heavier cracked products (LCO or HCO) from the FCC. The RCC (resid catalytic cracker) is a variant on the FCC. It is a similar unit yielding a similar range and quality of products, but it is designed to handle heavier atmospheric resid as a feed. How it works Heated feed is mixed with a heated catalyst and injected into a reactor, where the catalyst freely mixes with the feed as a fluid. As the feed is cracked, coke deposits on the catalyst, causing it to gradually deactivate. Cracked product is drawn off at the top of the reactor and is sent to a fractionator. Deactivated catalyst is drawn off the bottom of the reactor and is sent to a regenerator, where the coke is burned off by injecting heat and air. The cleaned (regenerated) catalyst is then sent back to the reactor, and the cycle repeats. The catalyst moves around the reactor and regenerator circuits in seconds at very high velocities, so many internal surfaces on the catalyst circuit have to be protected against erosion by having ceramic coatings. The heat generated in the regenerator from burning the coke off the catalyst provides the majority of the heat required for the separation reactions taking place in the reactor, and the unit has to be heat-balanced between the reactor and regenerator. Coke burned off the catalyst in the regenerator creates a mix of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide plus some SOx. This gas stream is passed through a CO boiler and recovery gas compressor to recover some energy, then cleaned of catalyst fines and evacuated to the atmosphere, so the FCC is a major emitter of CO2 from refineries. Inputs The feed to the FCC is a variety of heavy gasoils that would otherwise be blended into residual fuel oil. Typical feeds include: VGO - This heavy cut from the vacuum distillation unit is the major feed to the FCC. Often it will be processed through a gasoil hydrotreater to reduce its sulfur content before being fed to the FCC Coker gasoil - For refineries with a coker, this VGO range material from that unit is also a major feedstock for the FCC Products The FCC produces a range of mostly lighter products, with the most significant being FCC gasoline. Typical products are: FCC gasoline - This is a naphtha range material with octane and vapor pressure close to the quality specifications for finished gasoline. This is typically the largest product at around 50% of FCC output Cycle oils - The FCC produces a diesel range product called cycle oil. This is highly aromatic and often high in sulfur, which makes it a poor diesel blendstock. It is typically blended into lower quality diesel, used as a cutter stock in fuel oil blending, or sent to the hydrocracker for upgrading FCC slurry - The heaviest product from the the FCC is a highly aromatic resid stream, typically with high sulfur content. This is sent for fuel oil blending, used as feed for the coker, or used to make specialty products such as carbon black or needle coke FCC gas - The light ends from the FCC include both saturated and unsaturated C3s and C4s. This is typically sent to an unsaturated gas plant where the components are separated. The butylenes and sometimes the propylenes are fed to the alkylation unit if there is one. Lighter gases (ethane and methane) are sent to the fuel system Technology licensors include: KBR (Kellogg) - Orthoflow FCC technology UOP - FCC and RFCC technologies Axens/IFP - R2R RFCC technology Shell Global Solutions - FCC technology Foster Wheeler - FCC technology
* FCC gasoline	Also known as: cat gasoline, cat naphtha FCC gasoline is the primary product of the FCC unit. FCC gasoline has approximately the properties required for finished gasoline (octane and vapor pressure). It is typically one of the larger components in the gasoline blend pool.
* FCC gasoline hydrotreater	The FCC gasoline hydrotreater is used to reduce the sulfur content in the FCC gasoline stream produced in the FCC and RCC units. The catalysts used in these types of hydrotreaters are designed to keep the loss of octane as small as possible, but it is still common to lose 1.5-2 octane points.
* FCC slurry	Also known as: cat slurry, cat bottoms, decant oil FCC slurry is a highly aromatic resid stream produced by the FCC. Typical uses for FCC slurry are: Fuel oil blending - Cat slurry can be blended into residual fuel oil with minimal amounts of cutter stock to achieve the required viscosity Coker feed - FCC slurry can be blended with vacuum resid and used as feed to the coker Needle coke production - Because of its high aromatics content, FCC slurry tends to form needle-like crystalline carbon structures when coked. This needle coke is highly valued for manufacturing of electrodes. An important specialty market for FCC slurry is sales to specialized needle cokers that focus on making this product Carbon black production - The high aromatics content of FCC slurry makes it an excellent feedstock for the production of carbon black
* FEED	Also known as: Front-end engineering and design FEED is the step in the project engineering process after conceptual design and before detailed engineering. At the FEED step, the basic engineering takes place, including defining technical requirements and making preliminary cost estimates.
* Feedstock	Feedstock is any hydrocarbon input to a process unit. This could be crude oil or any intermediate refining stream. When the term feedstock is used for the feed to the entire refinery, it typically means non-crude feedstocks such as VGO and blendstocks. 
* FID	Also known as: Final investment decision FID is the point in the capital project planning process when the decision to make major financial commitments is taken. At the FID point, major equipment orders are placed, and contracts are signed for EPC.
* Fischer-Tropsch	Fischer-Tropsch is the most common process used to synthesize liquid fuels from on-oil sources (typically coal or natural gas). Fischer-Tropsch reacts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in the presence of a catalyst, to form liquid hydrocarbons. The feedstock gas mixture (called synthesis gas) is formed by gasifying coal or natural gas. Fischer-Tropsch is the basis for most GTL (gas-to-liquids) and CTL (coal-to-liquids) technologies.
* Fixed bed	Fixed bed reactors have a catalyst bed that is held in place, as opposed to an ebullated bed or fluidized bed. Consequently, the catalyst in fixed bed reactors cannot be drawn off and regenerated during operation, so it gradually and progressively deactivates as coke is produced as a reaction byproduct and enters and blocks the catalyst pores. This eventually forces the unit to be shut down so that the catalyst can be regenerated by burning off the coke or replaced by new catalyst.
* Fixed roof tank	A fixed roof tank is a storage tank for crude oil or refined products where the roof of the tank does not rise and fall with the level of material in the tank. For more volatile liquids, this requires use of natural gas to fill the void when the tank is not full.
* Flue gas	Flue gas is the exhaust gas from a furnace, boiler, or engine.
* Fluid coker	A fluid coker is a simplified version of a flexicoker in which coke is continuously drawn off, but only gasified to the extent necessary to fuel the coking process. Excess pet coke is still produced as a product.
* Fluidized bed	A fluidized bed is a catalyst bed type in which the catalyst is free flowing in a mixture with the reacting hydrocarbons (as opposed to being in a fixed or ebullating bed). In a fluidized bed, the catalyst is typically in the form of a fine powder for easy mixing and requires some method to separate it from the reactor products before they are drawn off.
* FOB	Also known as: Free On Board FOB is a common pricing basis for a commodity that is being shipped. FOB indicates that the price is for the commodity loaded onto a vessel and ready for shipping. So it includes the cost of the commodity and of loading, but not the cost to deliver it to its final destination. For a FOB sale, title to the oil passes to the buyer as the oil passes the loading flange of the loading ship. FOB pricing is common in markets where a commodity is exported in large volumes to multiple destinations.
* Formula price	Formula pricing is a method of crude or product pricing in which a predetermined formula sets the price of the commodity relative to other benchmark crude or product prices, with little or no month-to-month input from the buyer or seller. The formula is constructed so that changing market conditions are captured by changes in the benchmark prices used in the formulas. In some cases, an extra constant is added that has to be set monthly by one or both of the parties. In this case, the goal of the formula is to minimize the role that the changing constant plays.
* Forward contract	A forward contract is a contract between two parties for exchange of a volume of cargo at a specified future date for a specified price. For crude oil and refined products, there are two types of forward contracts: OTC (over the counter) - A custom, non-exchange-traded forward contract Futures - A standardized, exchange-traded paper contract
* Forward curve	The forward curve is the future prices over time for a commodity predicted by the market based on forward transactions.
* Fractional distillation	Also known as: distillation Fractional distillation is the primary method refiners use to separate hydrocarbon mixtures such as crude oil into its components. The main examples of fractional distillation in a refinery are the atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation units, and the various fractionators built into conversion units. How it works Fractional distillation uses the different boiling points for the components in a hydrocarbon mixture to achieve separation. Typically, the mixture is heated until most of the volume evaporates (boils off). The vapors are passed upwards through a series of trays and gradually lowered in temperature. Different components (called fractions or cuts) will condense back into liquid on different trays based on their boiling points, and are then drawn off. The lighter, lower-boiling point fractions will condense higher up, and the heavier, higher boiling point fractions will condense lower down. In practice, the lightest fraction is withdrawn out the top as a vapor, and the heaviest fraction remains in a liquid state the whole time and is drawn out at the bottom. For complex mixtures such as crude oil, the separated fractions still contain a wide mix of different components with boiling points in a range rather than at a single temperature.
* Fractionator	A fractionator is a "mini" distillation tower that uses fractional distillation to separate the components in a product stream from a conversion unit. Fractionators are common in many of the conversion units in a refinery. They are not considered separate process units but rather components of the conversion unit they are attached to.
* Freeze point	Freezing point is an important quality specification for jet fuel. This is the temperature at which components in the fuel start to solidify into wax crystals. Freezing point is measured as the temperature at which the last wax crystal melts when warming a fuel that has previously been cooled until wax crystals formed. Freezing point specifications are a maximum temperature. A material with a lower freezing point is more desirable. In general, low-density (lower boiling point) material will have a lower (more desirable) freezing point.
* Fresh feed rate	The fresh feed rate is the rate at which un-recycled feed is put into a process unit. Some units recycle a significant volume of unconverted product back into the unit as feed to increase yield. This effectively reduces the capacity of the unit.
* Fuel oil	Fuel oil is a broad term that could refer to a number of different refined products ranging in density from kerosene to residual fuel oil. However, it typically refers to residual fuel oil or No. 6 fuel oil. Grades of fuel oil used in US markets: No 1 - A fuel oil consisting of kerosene range material. Also called stove oil or range oil No 2 - A fuel oil consisting of light atmospheric gasoil material. This is the fuel oil used as a home heating oil. It is very similar to diesel but of lower quality. Typically, it has a lower cetane and higher sulfur content. Also called Bunker A No 3 - This is a now obsolete light gasoil range fuel oil, that has been combined with No 2 No 4 - A fuel oil consisting of VGO range material, intended for commercial heating furnaces lacking a preheater No 5 - A fuel oil consisting of vac resid range material with a low viscosity, allowing it to be pumped without preheating. Also called Bunker B No 6 - A fuel oil consisting of vac resid range material with a high viscosity, requiring preheating before pumping. Also called residual fuel oil or Bunker C
* Futures	Futures are highly standardized, exchange-traded forward contracts for crude and refined products. Only a limited number of commodities have futures contracts.

============ G ============
* Gain	Gain is the refining phenomenon in which the volume of refined product coming out of a refinery or conversion unit is greater than the volume of product going in. This has two potential causes: Change in density between inputs and outputs - If outputs have a lower density, even with the same mass of product as feedstock, volume will be higher Input of non liquid feeds - Often hydrogen gas is provided as a feedstock, which provides extra material and results in a volume gain relative to the liquid feedstock
* Gas plant	Also known as: saturated gas plant, sat gas plant, cracked gas plant The gas plant takes refinery gas from the distillation units and other process units and separates out the gas liquids. The goal of the gas plant is to separate the more valuable heavy components (propane, butane, etc) for product blending or feed to conversion, and send the lower value methane and ethane to the refinery fuel system. Often there are two gas plants: a saturated gas plant that handles gas streams that contain only saturated hydrocarbons (no olefins) and an unsaturated gas plant that handles streams from cracking units that contain unsaturated olefins such as butylene and propylene. The gas plant is actually made up of a number of process units that perform different stages of separation. The typical sequence is as follows: De-ethanizer - Gas is pressurized and sent through an absorption tower to separate methane and ethane from the heavier components, which are absorbed into a naphtha stream (lean oil) to form fat oil Sponge absorption - The gas stream (methane and ethane) from the de-ethanizer is fed to another absorption tower where a kerosene stream (sponge oil) is used to extract any lean oil that might have been carried over De-butanizer - The fat oil from the de-ethanizer is heated and sent to a fractionation tower that separates the propane and butane from the naphtha based on boiling points De-propanizer - The mixed propane/butane stream from the de-butanizer is sent to a second fractionation tower to separate propane from butane based on boiling points De-isobutanizer - In some refineries, the butane stream from the de-propanizer is further fractionated in a (very tall) column to separate normal butane from isobutane  
* Gas to liquid	Gas to liquid is a process for producing refined products directly from natural gas instead of from crude oil, using the Fischer-Tropsch process.
* Gasoil	Gasoil is a broad term that can refer to a range of intermediates and finished petroleum products, generally in the diesel or VGO range of distillation profile. Intermediates sometimes referred to as gasoil include: Light atmospheric gasoil (LAGO) - Diesel range straight run material from the atmospheric distillation tower Heavy atmospheric gasoil (HAGO) - Straight run material in between the diesel and VGO range from the atmospheric distillation tower Vacuum gasoil (VGO) - The lighter resid fraction from the vacuum distillation tower Coker gasoil - VGO range product from the coker Hydrocracked gasoil - VGO range material from the hydrocracker Finished petroleum products sometimes referred to as gasoil include: Diesel Heating oil or industrial gasoil Marine gasoil (marine diesel)
* Gasoline	Also known as: petrol, motor gasoline, mogas, benzine Gasoline is one of the major petroleum products produced from processing crude oil in a petroleum refinery. Gasoline is one of the higher-valued light products (along with jet fuel and diesel). It is used almost exclusively in the transportation sector, mostly as a fuel in automobiles and other light-duty vehicles. Demand for gasoline varies seasonally with the highest demand during the Northern Hemisphere summer. Summer is also when gasoline quality specifications (especially vapor pressure) tend to be tightest, resulting in generally higher prices in these months. Generally, refiners will try to maximize their yield of gasoline, along with diesel, to maximize profit. Since the two products draw from different boiling range material, they are largely complementary. However, there are a few conversion units that favor one over the other, forcing refiners to make a call on which will be more value-creating. Most notably, FCCs will tend to upgrade VGO more toward gasoline, and hydrocrackers will upgrade VGO more toward diesel. Gasoline product qualities Gasoline-powered vehicles use Otto cycle (spark ignition) engines. To perform well and to minimize environmental impact, this requires gasoline to have specific product qualities. Some of the more important ones are: Octane - A measure of a fuel's resistance to auto-igniting (knocking) when compressed with air in a spark ignition engine Vapor pressure - A fuel's volatility or tendency to vaporize Distillation profile - How much gasoline (volume %) evaporates at different temperatures Vapor lock index - The tendency of gasoline to vaporize in the fueling system, causing vapor lock Driveability index - A measure of a fuel's performance at both cold start and warmed-up conditions Sulfur content - A measure of the sulfur remaining in the fuel Aromatics content - Aromatics compounds include high-octane materials such as benzene, toluene, and xylene Benzene content - A known carcinogen for humans, consequently limited to very small amounts in many grades of gasoline Olefins content - Have a tendency to form coatings on engine walls, reducing performance over time Gasoline blending Gasoline is typically a complex blend of many different refinery intermediate streams. The most common refinery-produced components in the gasoline pool are: FCC gasoline from the FCC unit - Good octane and vapor pressure, but often high in sulfur and olefins Reformate from the reformer - High octane and low vapor pressure, but high in aromatics Alkylate from the alkylation unit - Good octane and vapor pressure with no aromatics, olefins, or sulfur Isomerate from the isomerization unit - Moderately good octane, low aromatics, and low sulfur, but high vapor pressure Light straight run naphtha directly from the distillation tower - Low octane and high vapor pressure Gasoline also often contains non-refinery-sourced blend components, either as octane enhancers or to satisfy a renewable fuels mandate. Typical non-refinery-sourced blendstocks include: Ethanol - High octane with no aromatics or sulfur, but high vapor pressure MTBE - High octane, no aromatics or sulfur, and low vapor pressure, but limited by environmental concerns related to storage and leakage to water reservoirs in some areas. It is banned across the US ETBE - High octane with no aromatics or sulfur, but high vapor pressure Gasoline is also blended with a number of additives to improve engine performance such as detergents. In the past, the additive TEL (a compound including lead) was blended into gasoline to raise its octane level. This practice has almost universally been eliminated out of environmental concerns, but is the reason gasoline is still often referred to as "unleaded."
* Green coke	Green coke is raw pet coke as it comes directly from the coker, before it has received any further treating such as calcining.
* Gross Margin	Gross margin is one common measure of refinery margin or economic performance. Gross margin is typically calculated per barrel of crude oil processed and is the difference between the value of the refined products produced and the cost of the crude oil and other feedstocks used to produce them. Typically, gross margin does not account for other costs such as energy, chemicals/catalysts, labor, materials, or fixed costs. However, sometimes the fuel generated by the refinery will be included in the product value in gross margin, and then also included in the energy cost when calculating variable cash margin. This has the effect of inflating the gross margin measure. Gross margin is the metric most useful in assessing the direct effect of market conditions on refinery economics, separate from the effects of operational performance.
* Group 3	Group 3 is the regional spot market for refined products in the US covering the Midwest Plains states.
* Group I base oil	Group I base oils are the lowest quality base oils. These are made with straight run material that has only had solvent extraction processing.
* Group II base oil	Group II base oil is base oil that includes some straight run and some hydrocracked material. This makes Group II base oil somewhat higher quality than Group I base oil.
* Group III base oil	Group III base oil is the highest quality petroleum-based base oil, produced entirely from hydrocracked material.
* Group IV base oil	Group IV base oils are non-petroleum synthetic base oils produced from poly-alpha-olefins.
* Gulf Coast	Also known as: US Gulf Coast, USGC, PADD 3 The US Gulf Coast is one of the major refining supply centers and spot market trading hubs. The Gulf Coast is typically defined to include the refineries located along the US coast of the Gulf of Mexico running from southern Texas to southern Alabama. This includes refining clusters in Corpus Christi (TX), Houston (TX), Beaumont/Port Arthur (TX), Lake Charles (LA), along the Mississippi River of Louisiana, and on the coast of Mississippi and Alabama. The Gulf Coast spot trading market generally includes trading of crude and oil products in the ports of Houston, Corpus Christi, and Beaumont/Port Arthur. This includes transactions of tanker and barge cargoes on the water and transactions at the injection point of key product pipelines such as Colonial, Plantation, and Explorer.

============ H ============
* H2S	Also known as: hydrogen sulfide H2S is a gas generated from the processing of crude oil or natural gas that contains sulfur. It is generated by conversion units cracking feedstock containing sulfur and from hydrotreaters that specifically focus on removing sulfur by creating H2S. H2S is highly toxic and generates highly polluting sulfur oxides if burned. Consequently, almost all H2S is extracted in the amine unit and sent to the sulfur plant for conversion into solid elemental sulfur.
* Heavy hydrocrackate	Heavy hydrocrackate is a heavy naphtha range product from a hydrocracker. It is typically used as a reformer feed. Because it is hydrocracked, it does not require hydrotreating before feeding into the reformer.
* Heavy naphtha	Also known as: reformable naphtha, heavy straight run naphtha Heavy naphtha is a distillation cut primarily made up of material roughly the same density as finished gasoline. Heavy naphtha molecules typically have from 7-9 carbon atoms. Its boiling range can be from 180F to 330F. Most of the heavy naphtha in a refinery comes directly from the atmospheric distillation unit. However, additional volumes may come from the hydrocracker (as heavy hydrocrackate) or from the coker (as coker naphtha). The heavy naphtha distillation cut is typically sent to the reformer to upgrade its quality to make it suitable as a gasoline blendstock. Heavy naphtha can also be blended directly into gasoline, but its low octane makes this undesirable. Most of th naphtha sent to the reformer must first be hydrotreated to remove impurities that are harmful to the reformer catalyst. The exception is naphtha from a hydrocracker, which is essentially already hydroteated. Refiners can adjust the cut points of heavy naphtha to shift volume into light naphtha and/or kerosene, and to reduce the volume going to the reformer. Shifting the heavier end of the heavy naphtha into kerosene allows a refiner to increase kerosene and diesel yield, but at the cost of lowering the flash point of the kerosene.
* Hedging	Hedging is the use of commercial contracts to reduce market risk exposure.
* HF alkylation	HF alkylation is one of the two alkylation processes, the other being sulfuric acid alkylation. In both processes, the acid acts as a catalyst.
* Higher heating value	Higher heating value is a measure of the amount of heat generated from full combustion of a hydrocarbon and a return of all combustion products (including steam) to pre-combustion temperature. This is in contrast to lower heating value, which does not account for the heat contained in combustion products if not returned to pre-combustion temperature. Higher heating value is most relevant to industrial combustion systems where maximum heat capture is possible.
* Houston Ship Channel	The Houston Ship Channel is the waterway running through the Port of Houston, Texas, in the US. It is the site of a large number of refineries and other petrochemical plants and is the center for refined products shipping and spot market trading on the US Gulf Coast.
* HSE	Also known as: Health, safety, and environment, HSSE HSE refers to a refinery's performance in protecting worker health and safety, and the impact of the refinery's operations on the environment.
* Hub market	Hub markets are the large regional refining centers that tend to act as swing capacity for the global market and the location for most spot market trade in refined products. The three main hub markets are: Northwest Europe, centered around the refineries in the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp (ARA) US Gulf Coast, centered around the refineries on the coast of Texas and Louisiana Singapore
* Hydrocarbon	Hydrocarbons are any substances made up of carbon and hydrogen. This includes crude oil and all petroleum products, as well as natural gas and coal.
* Hydrocracker	Also known as: HCK, HCU, unicracker, VGO hydrocracker In a refinery, the hydrocracker upgrades VGO through cracking while injecting hydrogen. This yields a high volume of high-quality diesel and kerosene product. This is in contrast to the FCC, which uses the same feed (VGO) but produces more and better-quality gasoline. The hydrocracker is particularly valuable in a refinery that is trying to maximize diesel production and reduce residual fuel oil. The hydrocracker yields a high volume of kerosene and light gasoil (distillate) of good quality (high cetane and low sulfur). However, its volume yield of naphtha is low and of low quality (low N+A). Markets that have very low sulfur limits for diesel also favor use of hydrocrackers, as the diesel product does not need subsequent hydrotreating. Often, to achieve a high yield of light products with a balance between gasoline and diesel, a refinery will have both an FCC and a hydrocracker. In this case, the two units can be highly complimentary, with the FCC taking the unconverted feed from the hydrocracker and the hydrocracker taking the heavier cracked products (LCO or HCO) from the FCC.  The flexiblity in the design and operation of hydrocrackers allows a wide range of feeds and of product yields. However this comes at very high capital and operating costs. A resid hydrocracker is a variant on the typical VGO hydrocracker. It is a similar unit yielding a similar range and quality of products, but it is designed to handle heavier vacuum resid as a feed. How it works In a two-stage hydrocracker, a mixture of hydrocarbon feed and hydrogen is heated and injected into a reactor vessel containing a hydrotreating catalyst. This catalyst accelerates the reactions that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the hydrocarbon and open up and saturate aromatics rings. The entire output from this reactor is then injected into a second reactor containing a hydrocracking catalyst, which helps the reactions that crack apart the hydrocarbons while saturating them with hydrogen. The resulting mix of converted and unconverted hydrocarbon is then separated. Unconverted hydrocarbon can then be recycled to the hydrocracking step for further conversion, sent to a second hydrocracking vessel, or sent to another conversion unit as feed (e.g., an FCC). Diesel range material can also be drawn off at the separation steps to maximize diesel production, or it can be processed further (through recycling or second-step hydrocracking) to maximize naphtha production. Some hydrocrackers are single-stage units with just one reactor that is usually filled with hydrocracking catalyst, but the rest of the process is the same. Inputs Hydrocrackers can take a wide variety of feeds depending upon the desired products. The most common are: VGO - This lighter fraction from the vacuum distillation unit is the most common feed for most hydrocrackers. It is a desirable feed when the refiner is attempting to maximize overall diesel production Coker gasoil - This VGO-range product from the coker is well suited to a hydrocracker, which is better able to handle its unsaturated components than an FCC unit is Cycle oils and cracked distillates - These low-quality diesel-range streams can be hydrocracked to make jet fuel and gasoline-range material Atmospheric gasoil - This straight run diesel-range material can be hydrocracked to increase gasoline production by generating additional naphtha feed for the reformer Products A hydrocracker can produce a wide range of products depending upon what feed it processes and how it is designed and operated. Typical products are: Hydrocracked distillate - This is a high-quality diesel blendstock (high cetane and low sulfur) Hydrocracked gasoil (also known as unconverted oil) - It is a low-sulfur, VGO-range material that can be used as feedstock for FCC units or steam crackers Hydrocracked kerosene - This is a high-quality jet fuel (or diesel) blendstock with low sulfur and high smoke point Heavy hydrocrackate - This is a good-quality reformer feed, with moderate N+A and low sulfur Light hydrocrackate- This is a low-quality gasoline blendstock with low octane but also low sulfur Isobutane - This is valuable in a refinery with an alkylation unit that requires isobutane as a feedstock
* Hydrocracker distillate	Hydrocracker distillate is one of the key products from the hydrocracker. It is a high-quality diesel blendstock, with low sulfur and high cetane.
* Hydrocracker gasoil	Also known as: unconverted oil, slack wax Hydrocracked gasoil is a low-sulfur VGO boiling range material produced by the hydrocracker. Its primary use is as a feed into the FCC unit.
* Hydrocracker kerosene	Hydrocracked kerosene is a low-sulfur kerosene boiling range material produced by the hydrocracker. It's primarily used as a blendstock into jet fuel or diesel.
* Hydrofluoric acid	Also known as: HF In refining, HF is one of the two acids used as a catalyst in the alkylation process, the other being sulfuric acid. Although HF units generally have better yields than sulfuric acid units, new alkylation units are almost exclusively sulfuric acid design. This comes from concern over the extreme toxicity of HF and the resulting costs of risk mitigation that go into using an HF unit.
* Hydrogen	Also known as: H2 In a refinery, hydrogen gas is an important feedstock to many process units, which use it to remove impurities (e.g., hydrotreaters) and to saturate cracked components (e.g., hydrocrackers). Hydrogen is generated as a byproduct of the reforming process and is also made on purpose in the hydrogen plant.
* Hydrogen production	Many refineries must intentionally generate hydrogen to supply all the needs of the hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers. Refineries with a reformer typically generate a large portion of the hydrogen they need, but often this must be supplemented with intentional hydrogen generation, especially when making ultra-low sulfur fuels or when using a hydrocracker for conversion. There are two major process options to make hydrogen, using either light ends or fuel oil as a feed: Steam reforming - A catalytic process for making hydrogen from steam and a light hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane, or propane Partial oxidation - A process for generating hydrogen through partial combustion of fuel oil (to CO) and injection of steam to force production of H2
* Hydrogen recovery	Hydrogen recovery captures the hydrogen from refinery gas streams coming from the hydrotreaters and hydrocracker. There are three common methods for hydrogen recovery: Cryogenic hydrogen recovery - The gas mixture is cooled to the point that the non-hydrogen components drop out as a liquid, allowing separation from the hydrogen Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) - The gas mixture is passed through a molecular sieve solid adsorbent, which adsorbs the hydrocarbon and allows the hydrogen to pass through Membrane diffusion - The gas mixture is separated by using pressure to force the hydrogen through a membrane that is hydrogen permeable but not permeable to large hydrocarbons
* Hydrogenation	Hydrogenation is any process or reaction in which hydrogen is added to an unsaturated hydrocarbon molecule.
* Hydroskimming	Hydroskimming is a refining configuration that consists only of atmospheric distillation, reforming, and hydrotreating. It gets its name from having a reformer ("hydroskimmer") as its only real conversion unit. Hydroskimming is a very simple configuration and is therefore often the marginal configuration in a market with a lot of simple refineries.
* Hydrotreater	Also known as: hydrodesulfurization, HTU, HDS unit The purpose of a hydrotreater unit is primarily to remove sulfur and other contaminants from intermediate streams before blending into a finished refined product or before being fed into another refinery process unit. Hydrotreaters have become increasingly important as sulfur limits have been lowered in finished products. Also, for some key conversion units such as the reformer, feed must be hydrotreated to keep contaminants from poisoning the conversion catalyst. Hydrotreaters also saturate aromatics and olefins if operated at high pressure, which is great for diesel quality (raises cetane) but bad for gasoline (reduces octane). Types of hydrotreaters It is quite common for a refinery to have multiple hydrotreaters. Some of the more common are: Naphtha hydrotreater - Hydrotreats heavy naphtha before it is fed to the reformer Kerosene hydrotreater - Hydrotreats kerosene to remove sulfur and to improve smoke point properties for jet fuel Distillate hydrotreater - Hydrotreats diesel blendstocks to remove sulfur and nitrogen and raise cetane VGO hydrotreater - Hydrotreats VGO before feeding into the FCC. This reduces sulfur, resulting in lower sulfur products (FCC gasoline, cycle oil) FCC gasoline hydrotreater - Hydrotreats the FCC gasoline coming out of the FCC, which is often high in sulfur Resid hydrotreater - Hydrotreats atmospheric resid or vacuum resid to reduce sulfur, sometimes before sending it to an RCC unit for upgrading How it works The hydrocarbon is mixed with hydrogen and heated to 500-750F. The mixture is injected into a reactor vessel filled with a solid metal catalyst (cobalt-molybdenum or nickel-molybdenum). In the presence of the catalyst and heat, the hydrogen reacts with the hydrocarbon, removing sulfur (to form H2S), removing nitrogen (to form ammonia), and saturating olefins and aromatics with hydrogen. Typically, there is also a small amount of hydrocarbon cracking to form methane, ethane, propane, and butane. The operating pressure of any hydrotreating unit is elevated to reduce the amount of coke laydown on the catalysts, which are normally in fixed beds. In general, the heavier the type of feedstock, the higher the operating pressure of the unit.

============ I ============
* ICE	Also known as: Intercontinental Exchange ICE is one of the two main futures exchanges for crude oil (the other being NYMEX). ICE is primarily known for its Brent futures contract.
* IEA	Also known as: International Energy Agency The IEA is the branch of the OECD responsible for monitoring energy markets.
* IFP	Also known as: Institut Francais du Petrole IFP is a research organization that has developed an array of refining technologies and catalysts. These are largely licensed through their commercial partner Axens.
* IMO	Also known as: International Marine Organization The IMO is an international treaty organization under the United Nations that establishes the Law of the Seas. Included in its mandate is the regulation of shipping fuels and emissions under the Marpol (Marine Pollution) convention. Under Marpol, the IMO regulates the sulfur limits for bunker fuel, a key product from oil refining.
* Import parity	Also known as: IPP Import parity is a price-setting mechanism for a commodity in which the price is set based on the cost of importing the commodity into a location. Import parity is calculated as the cost of the commodity in the source location, plus the cost of delivery to the destination. Import parity pricing is typical in a market that is consistently short of a commodity and importing marginal supply from another market. Import parity pricing can occur either through market forces or be set directly through contracted terms.
* Independent	An independent company is one that plays in only one part of the petroleum value chain (upstream or downstream). This is in contrast to an integrated oil company (IOC) that plays across the value chain.
* Industrial gasoil	Also known as: No. 2 oil, IGO, heating oil, MGO, marine gasoil, furnace oil Industrial gasoil is a diesel boiling range light product used for non-transportation purposes. It differs from diesel primarily in not having a cetane limit and also often having a slightly higher end point than diesel. This allows it to contain more of the low-cetane diesel range blend stocks such as LCO. There are different varieties of industrial gasoils based on specific end uses: Home heating oil - Used as a furnace fuel in homes and commercial buildings Industrial gasoil - Used as a fuel in industrial furnaces Marine gasoil - Used as a fuel in ship boilers
* Initial boiling point	Also known as: IBP The initial boiling point for a distillation fraction is the temperature at which the fraction just begins to evaporate when distilled. This means it is also in theory the cut point between the fraction and the next lightest fraction being distilled, and is the end point of that lighter fraction. However, in reality the true initial boiling point of a fraction is typically lower than the true end point of the next lightest fraction (they overlap) because they are complex mixtures of different hydrocarbons. Consequently, refiners in practice split the difference and define an "effective" initial boiling point that is in between and therefore higher than the true initial boiling point.
* Integrated oil company	Also known as: IOC, Major Integrated oil companies are ones that play across the entire petroleum value chain from oil exploration and production (upstream) to transport, refining, and marketing (downstream).
* Integration	Integration is when a company participates in adjacent segments of the oil value chain, especially when they physically exhange streams between the segments, thereby avoiding exposure to the market.
* Intermediates	Also known as: intermediate streams, blend stocks, unfinished oils An intermediate refers to any refinery hydrocarbon stream that is not a crude oil or one of the finished petroleum products (such as gasoline). This includes all of the outputs from distillation (distillation fractions) and from the conversion units. Typically, intermediates are produced and consumed within the same refinery. Most are used as feed to conversion units or as blend stocks to make finished products. However, it is not uncommon for refineries to trade small volumes of intermediates among themselves on occasion.
* Inventory	Inventory is the volume of crude and refined products that a refinery maintains in tanks. Most inventory is operational inventory to satisfy the needs of operations.
* Isobutane	Also known as: i-Butane, iC4 Isobutane is an branched-chain isomer of normal butane. Isobutane is particularly valuable in a refinery as a feedstock to the alkyaltion unit, where it is combined with either propylene or butylene to make alkylate (a high-quality gasoline blend stock). Isobutane is produced in a variety of conversion units in a refinery. However, when a refinery has an alky there is usually a need to make additional isobutane "on purpose" to keep the alky full. This is done by isomerizing normal butane in a C4 Isomerization unit.
* Isomer	Isomers are hydrocarbons that have the same chemical formula but different structures, and therefore have different physical characteristics. An example is butane and isobutane, which both have the formula C4H10, but butane is a straight chain and isobutane is a branched chain.
* Isomerate	Isomerate is a gasoline blend stock produced by the isomerization unit through increasing the octane of light naphtha.
* Isomerization	Also known as: C5/C6 isom The isomerization unit converts light naphtha into a higher-value gasoline blendstock by changing its molecular shape and raising its octane. The primary product of isomerization is called isomerate. The value from isomerization is its ability to upgrade light naphtha into gasoline. While the resulting isomerate is not high octane (typically 82-87 RON), it is much better than light naphtha at around 70 RON. How it works Light naphtha that contains C5s and C6s is mixed with a small amount of hydrogen, raised to 200-400F (93-204C), and injected into a reactor vessel containing a platinum catalyst. The catalyst and heat convert the C5 and C6 molecules into their isomers. Typically, unreacted C5s and C6s are recycled to increase yield.

============ J ============
* Jet A	Jet A is the standard grade of aviation turbine fuel (jet fuel) used in the US. It has a slightly higher freeze point (-40C) than the Jet A-1 grade (-47C) used in international aviation.
* Jet A-1	Jet A-1 is the standard international grade of commercial aviation turbine fuel (jet fuel). Jet A-1 has a lower freeze point than Jet A (the grade commonly used in the US), which is better suited to high-altitude intercontinental flights, especially over polar regions. Jet A-1 fuel must meet the following standards: DEF STAN 91-91 ASTM specification D1655 IATA Guidance Material (Kerosene type), NATO Code F-35 Some physical properties for Jet A-1 within ASTM specification D1655: Flash point: 38C Freezing point: -47C Density at 15C: 0.804 kg/L
* Jet fuel	Also known as: jet kero, turbo kerosene Jet fuel is one of the major petroleum products produced from processing crude oil in a petroleum refinery. Jet fuel is one of the higher-valued light products (along with gasoline and diesel). It is used primarily in the transportation sector. It is the primary fuel used in jet aircraft, but it is also used in other jet turbine applications. The same material used to make jet fuel is also sold as the product kerosene for non-aircraft uses, but with lower quality specifications. The kerosene used to make jet fuel has a boiling range in between gasoline and diesel range material. Consequently, jet fuel can be a swing fuel, stealing volume from gasoline and diesel when jet fuel prices are high, and contributing volume when jet fuel prices are low. There are a number of different grades of jet fuel for different uses and markets: Jet A-1 - The standard grade for international commercial aviation Jet A - The standard grade for US domestic aviation Jet fuel qualities The use of jet fuel in high-performance jet turbines, at high altitudes and low pressures, requires jet fuel to have very specific product qualities. Some of the more important ones are: Smoke point - A measure of the tendency of a fuel to emit smoke (carbonacious particles) when burned in a jet turbine Flash point - A measure of the temperature at which a fuel forms a potentially ignitable mixture of hydrocarbon and air Freeze point - The temperature at which a fuel starts to form solid crystals Jet fuel blending Jet fuel is typically a simple blend of a few different kerosene streams. The most common components are: Straight run kerosene from the crude tower, sometimes via a kerosene merox unit Hydrotreated kerosene from the kerosene hydrotreater Hydrocracker kerosene from the hydrocracker

============ K ============
* Kerosene	Also known as: kero, kerosine Kerosene is a distillation cut primarily made up of molecules with 9 to 12 carbon atoms. The kerosene distillation cut has a boiling range between 330 and 550F. The primary use of kerosene is as a blend stock to make jet fuel. It can also be sold directly as kerosene fuel oil (No. 1 fuel oil), which goes by a number of names including stove oil, lamp oil, and range oil. A highly purified form of kerosene (white oil) is used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food products. Kerosene can also be blended in significant amounts into diesel fuel. The lighter end of the kerosene distillation cut can also be lifted into the heavy naphtha cut above to increase the volume of feed to the reformer. This is one lever that the refinery has to shift its yield away from diesel and toward gasoline. Also, if necessary, kerosene will be used as a cutter stock to reduce the viscosity of residual fuel oil. However, this results in a significant value downgrade for kerosene, versus its other uses, so will be kept to a minimum.
* Kerosene hydrotreater	A hydrotreater is used to reduce the sulfur levels of kerosene streams, primarily from atmospheric distillation.
* Knocking	Knocking is a phenomenon that occurs in a gasoline engine if the fuel used does not have a high enough octane rating. Knocking is essentially combustion at the wrong time. It gets its name from the pinging or knocking noise that it makes. More importantly, it results in lower fuel efficiency and hotter engine temperatures, and it can lead to engine damage over time.

============ L ============
* Laboratory	In a refinery, the laboratory is responsible for physical testing of crude, products, and intermediate streams. This testing can range from generating a full assay for a crude sample to testing a single property in a product such as gasoline octane. Many refineries rely on both an on-site laboratory and off-site third-party laboratories for their testing needs.

* Laycan	Also known as: Laydays commencement and canceling Laycan is the period in which a tanker must be ready to load or discharge cargo.
* Light ends	Light ends are the light hydrocarbon gases and liquids that come off the top of distillation towers and fractionators. This usually includes refinery gas and some C3s and C4s.
* Light hydrocrackate	Light hydrocrackate is a light naphtha boiling range intermediate produced by the hydrocracker. It is typically fed to the C5/C6 isomerization unit, blended directly into gasoline, or sold as light naphtha for use as a petrochemical feedstock.
* Light naphtha	Also known as: light straight run naphtha, LSR, natural gasoline, light paraffinic naphtha, pentanes plus, C5+ Light naphtha can refer to either a finished product used as a petrochemical feedstock or a distillation cut commonly called light straight run naphtha. It is composed of pentane and slightly heavier material. Light naphtha comes from distillation of crude oil or from separation of NGLs in an NGL fractionation plant. Light naphtha from NGL fractionation is often called natural gasoline or pentanes plus. In a refinery, light naphtha is often blended directly into gasoline. However, its low octane and relatively high vapor pressure typically limit it to 5% or less of the gasoline pool. To boost its octane, it is often sent to the isomerization unit before gasoline blending. As a petrochemical feed stock, light naphtha is used in steam crackers to make ethylene and ultimately make plastics. In this use, it competes with propane and ethane as a feedstock. Highly paraffinic naphtha is preferred in this use as it provides better yields than more naphthenic or aromatic naphthas.
* Light straight run naphtha	Also known as: pentanes plus, light paraffinic naphtha, natural gasoline Light straight run naphtha is a distillation cut made up of pentane and slightly heavier naphtha range material. Light naphtha can come either from crude distillation or from fractionation of NGLs (natural gasoline). The light naphtha distillation cut has three typical uses: Blending directly into a finished light naphtha product Feed to the isomerization unit to make isomerate for blending into gasoline Direct blending into gasoline As a blend stock for making gasoline, light naphtha is of fairly low quality. It tends to have low octane and high vapor pressure. So it typically only makes up a very small portion of the gasoline pool.
* Lightering	Lightering is the use of a small tanker or barge to move a cargo between a larger ship and shore. This can be either at loading or unloading. Typically this is done to allow use of a ship that is too large to dock directly. This adds to the cost of shipping, but it can be more than offset by the savings from using the larger ship.
* Light-heavy differential	The light-heavy product price differential is a measure of the difference in price between light products (e.g., gasoline and diesel) and heavy fuel oil. The light-heavy differential is a key measure of refinery market conditions. Refiners generally have higher profitability when the light-heavy differential is wide (i.e., has a high value) because they get higher value for the refined products that they primarily produce (i.e., gasoline and diesel) and have lower costs for any medium and heavy crude oil that they process. Measures of the light-heavy differential There are a number of possible measures of the light-heavy differential, but the most common is the difference between light and heavy products, calculated as: 50% gasoline price + 50% diesel price - High sulfur fuel oil price The light-heavy differential is also sometimes measured as the spread between a light and heavy crude oil, for example: Brent -Dubai. This correlates strongly with the product light-heavy measure, but it is a less exact measure as it is also affected by the differences in sulfur content and and product yield of the two crudes beyond just light and heavy.
* Linear program	Also known as: LP model The LP model is an analytical tool used at most refineries to make economically optimal short-term decisions around operations and commercial activities. Given a set of market conditions (crude and product prices and volumes) and refinery capabilities (capacities and yields), the LP determines the choices of feedstock, refinery utilization, and product make that generate the highest variable cash profitability for the refinery.
* LOOP	Also known as: Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LOOP is a crude oil unloading terminal located off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. LOOP has the ability to unload VLCC tankers that are too large to dock at other Gulf Coast ports. It is connected by pipeline to salt caverns onshore that can hold large quantities of crude and is connected to refiners across the Gulf Coast by pipeline and the intra-coastal waterway. LOOP has been a major port for receiving crude oil imports into the US from around the world.
* Lower heating value	Lower heating value is a measure of the amount of heat generated from full combustion of a hydrocarbon not accounting for the heat contained in combustion products if not returned to pre-combustion temperature. Lower heating value is most relevant for fuels used in small engines (automobiles) that cannot capture the energy in exhaust gases.
* LPG	Also known as: Liquefied petroleum gas, commercial propane LPG refers to the lightest (lowest density) liquid fuels produced by a refinery, primarily C3s (propane) and some C4s (butane). As a product, it typically refers to commercial propane, which is primarily propane with a small amount of butane. LPG is commonly used as a fuel where it is valued for being easily transported and is easily vaporized at room temperature to form a fuel gas. In many underdeveloped markets, it is an important cooking fuel. In areas without infrastructure to provide natural gas, it is often used as a home heating fuel. It is also used as a specialty light-vehicle fuel in forklifts and taxi fleets. Propane in its purer form also has other industrial uses. Propane is a major feed to steam crackers for the production of ethylene. Propane is used in farming as a drying agent for grain. LPG is also often used as refinery fuel if there is a limited ability to separate the LPG from refinery gas, or if there is a limited local market for LPG. However, separation for use in LPG blending is almost always a more valuable use if this option is possible. LPG production The propane and butane blended into LPG can come from many different process units in the refinery, as well as from outside sources such as natural gas plants (from separating NGLs) or steam crackers (from C4 raffinates). Major sources inside the refinery include: Atmospheric distillation - All crude oils yield some amount of propane and butane when distilled. Typically, they leave the distillation tower in a wet gas stream that is sent to the saturated gas plant for separation of propane and butane from lighter gases (methane and ethane) that are then used for refinery fuel FCC - In the FCC conversion process, large amounts of C3s and C4s are produced, including both saturated propane and butane and unsaturated propylene and butylene. Often the unsaturated olefins are separated for use as feed to the alkylation unit or as feed to petrochemicals units Coker - Similar to the FCC, the coker conversion process generates mixed C3s and C4s containing saturated and unsaturated molecules. However, it is less common for coker C3s and C4s to have their olefins separated out Reformer - Reformers will yield approximately 5% (by volume) of both C3s and C4s in the conversion process LPG product quality LPG (or commercial propane) typically contains ~90%+ propane and less than 10% butane. Typical specifications are: Vapor pressure: 124 psig at 70F; 192 psig at 100F; 286 psig at 130F Specific gravity: 0.509 at 60F Initial boiling point: -51F at 1 bar Dew point: -46F at 1 bar Specific heat: 0.588 Btu/lb at 60F; 2.462 kJ/kg at 15.6C Lower limit of flammability: 2.4 vol% gas in air Upper limit of flammability: 9.6 vol% gas in air Latent heat of vaporization: 185 Btu/lb; 430.3 kJ/kg Gross heating value (liquid): 21,550 Btu/lb; 50,125 kJ/kg Gross heating value (gas): 2,560 Btu/ft3; 9,538 kJ/m3   
* LR1	LR1 refers to a class of oil product tanker of small size or Panamax class (60-80 DWT). 
* LR2	LR2 refers to a class of refined product tanker of medium size or Aframax class (80-120 DWT).
* LSWR	Also known as: Low sulfur waxy residue LSWR is a low sulfur resid produced primarily in Indonesia and used as a conversion feedstock and fuel oil blend stock across Asia.
* LTO	Also known as: Light tight oil, shale oil, unconventional oil Light tight oil is crude oil produced from thin, tight formations using unconventional production techniques including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Light tight oil production is concentrated in the US where it is the primary source of oil supply growth over the past few years. Major production areas include the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Bakken formation of North Dakota. LTO is generally a very light (API 45-50) and sweet (< 0.1% sulfur) crude grade.
* Lubes plant	Also known as: base oil plant The lubes unit extracts high-viscosity heavy material from VGO and vac resid to produce base oils. Base oils are the blend stocks for producing finished lubricating oils such as motor oil. Base oils are a specialty product of very high value. So even though the volumes of base oil produced in a plant may be very small, it can contribute significantly to overall refinery profitability. However, the capital cost per barrel of lubes plants is relatively high, so only a subset of refineries have installed them. The lubes or base oil plant typically consists of several different steps of processing, though not all plants will have all of the steps. These include: Propane deasphalting - A solvent extraction process that uses propane to separate asphaltenes and other undesirable material from vacuum resid to yield base oil Lubes aromatics extraction - A solvent extraction process that uses furfural, phenol, or NMP to extract aromatics from VGO or deasphalted vac resid Dewaxing - A solvent extraction process that uses ketone (or sometimes propane) to remove wax from base oil Lubes hydrocracking - Selective hydrocracking of aromatics-extracted base oil to reduce pour point and to crack waxy molecules Lubes hydrotreating - Mild hydrotreating of base oil to improve color and stability by removing chemically active compounds
* Lubricants	Also known as: Motor oil, lubricating oil Lubricants are a class of refined products made from base oils and used to lubricate engines (trucks and automobiles) and other machinery. Blending of lubricants from base oils can be done either at a refinery, where base oils and produced, or at separate blending and packaging plants that bring base oil in from refineries.

============ M ============
* M85	M85 is a mix of methanol (85%) and gasoline (15%) used as an alternative transportation fuel.
* Magellan East Houston	Also known as: MEH Magellan East Houston is a crude oil terminal in Houston, Texas, that is an aggregation point for crude brought down to the Gulf Coast from inland producing regions. MEH serves as the pricing point for WTI on the the Gulf Coast.
* Marginal configuration	Marginal configuration is the refinery configuration that is operating at the margin in a market, balancing refined product supply and setting market conditions by its break-even economics. Marginal configuration is one of the key price-setting mechanisms for refined products markets. Under tight market (high utilization) conditions, the marginal configuration shifts to a less complex configuration, forcing margins to improve to bring that configuration to economic break-even levels. Under lower utilization conditions, the marginal configuration shifts to more complex configuration, reducing the margin condition needed to be at economic break-even. The type of configurations likely to be marginal (price setting) vary across markets based on differences in refinery capacity and demand volatility.
* Margins	Refinery margins are a measure of the value contribution of the refinery per unit of input. Typically this is per barrel of crude oil processed, but it could also include other feedstocks as inputs. Refiners typically measure margins at several levels to measure different dimensions of performance: Gross margin - This is the difference between the value of the products made and the feedstock (crude and other feed) used to make them. This is typically used to measure the effects of changing market conditions or differences in yield across different refineries Variable cash margin - This subtracts all variable costs (costs associated with running a single unit of feedstock, typically including energy and catalyst and chemicals costs) from the gross margin. This is a measure of the value of marginal units of production and is useful for setting optimal short-term run levels and for evaluating crude and product slate options as part of refinery optimization Cash operating margin - This subtracts all fixed cash costs (labor, maintenance, and materials) from variable cash margin. This is a measure of the cash contribution to the business from continuing to run the refinery on an ongoing basis
* Markets	Crude oil and refined products are bought and sold at points all along the oil value chain, from the wellhead to the final fuel consumer. However, when we speak of oil markets, we typically are referring to one of three key steps in the value chain: Spot market - The most important and active oil markets are the spot markets. This is where large physical parcels or cargoes of crude oil and the major refined products are bought and sold, mostly by oil companies and large trading houses Wholesale (rack ) market - In many local markets, there is also active wholesale trade in oil products out of distribution terminals (at the Rack) End-user market - The end-user market for oil products includes both retail fuel sales and significant business-to-business sales to large fuel consumers such as airlines and railroads
* Marpol	Also known as: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships Marpol is the international convention or treaty that regulates pollution from ships at sea. This includes the regulation of sulfur emissions from the burning of bunker fuel, a key product of oil refining. Marpol is administered under the IMO.
* Max distillate	Max distillate is a mode of operation for refiners where they are trying to maximize the production of distillates (diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel) at the expense of gasoline.
* Max gasoline	Max gasoline is a mode of operation for refiners where they are trying to maximize the production of gasoline at the expense of distillates (diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel).
* Maya crude	Maya is a heavy sour crude oil grade produced in Mexico. Maya is an important benchmark for heavy sour crude oils in the US Gulf Coast market. Quality: API: 22.0 Sulfur: 3.30%
* Mcf	Also known as: thousand cubic feet Mcf is a common measurement of volume for natural gas in the US.
* Mean of Platts Singapore	Also known as: MOPS Mean of Platts Singapore is a pricing basis for many refined products in southeast Asia. It refers to the average price reported by the price assessment agency Platts for a product in the Singapore trading hub. For most refined products, MOPS is the benchmark price for the Asia market.
* Mechanical availability	Mechanical availability is a measure of a refinery or process unit's capacity to operate based on the condition of the equipment, without adjusting for any other operational or commercial limits. This is effectively the maximum physical capability for the hardware. Mechanical availability is a key metric for the maintenance organization of a refinery.
* MEK	Also known as: Methyl ethyl ketone MEK is one of the solvents used in the dewaxing units of a lubes plant. The alternative to using a ketone such as MEK is propane.
* Mercaptan	Also known as: Thiol Mercaptans are highly odorous sulfur-containing hydrocarbons that are often removed from light products such as LPG or jet fuel in a merox unit. Mercaptans have a chemical structure that includes a hydrogen atom bonded to a sulfur atom bonded to a carbon atom, with the generic formula R-SH. Mercaptans can be removed in hydrotreaters and by sweetening in merox units.
* Merox	Also known as: kerosene merox, lpg merox The merox unit is a proprietary UOP technology that selectively sweetens petroleum products by oxidizing the foul-smelling mercaptans into the sweeter disulfides which remain in the product, leaving the total sulfur content the same. The process is sometimes known as a sweetening process and is much cheaper to install than a hydrotreater, which actually lowers the sulfur content. Merox is primarily used to sweeten mercaptans from jet fuel or from LPG. In the merox process, the mercaptan is oxidized by means of a proprietary UOP catalyst, in an alkaline environment. The merox process is preferred for jet fuel sweetening over hydrotreating, because it is less expensive and jet fuel's high sulfur limit (3,000 ppm) does not require the removal of the other sulfur compounds that hydrotreating provides.
* Metals	Metals occur naturally in crude oil and pose a risk to conversion unit catalysts when present in high concentration. The metals most commonly found are: Nickel - Affects FCC catalyst activity Vanadium - Affects FCC catalyst activity Copper
* Methane	Methane is a simple hydrocarbon with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. In a refinery, methane is produced in the refinery gas stream of many conversion units. It is also often purchased from outside the refinery as natural gas. Methane is generally consumed as a fuel in a refinery and is also used as a feedstock in hydrogen production.
* Methanol	Also known as: Methyl alcohol, MeOH Methanol is an important petrochemical produced from natural gas and used to make the gasoline oxygenate blend stock MTBE. Methanol can also be used directly as a transporation fuel or in a blend with gasoline (M85).

* Midstream	The midstream is the part of the petroleum value chain focused on transportation of crude oil and refined products. It is usually defined to include: Movement of crude, NGLs, and product by pipeline, tanker truck, barge, tanker, and rail Storage of crude and product outside of refineries Fractionation of NGLs into components
* MMBtu	Also known as: Million British thermal units MMBtu is a common measure of energy content for crude oil and refined products, and a volume measurement for natural gas.
* MON	Also known as: Motor octane MON is one of the two primary measures of the octane value of gasoline or a gasoline blend stock. MON is a measure of octane value under challenging conditions such as high speed or with a heavy load. 
* Mont Belvieu	Mont Belvieu is a major hub for NGL fractionation and trading, located on the US Gulf Coast outside of Houston, Texas.
* MTBE	Also known as: Methyl-tertiarybutyl-ether MTBE is a common blend stock into gasoline. It is valued both as a source of octane and as an oxygenate to reduce the carbon monoxide emissions from burning gasoline. MTBE is made from methanol (usually produced from natural gas) and isobutylene, providing a route for converting natural gas into higher-value gasoline. MTBE use is encouraged in some markets by gasoline regulations that require a minimum volume of oxygen to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. In this role, it competes with ETBE and ethanol. MTBE use is restricted in some markets over concern about its potential toxicity and its tendency to accumulate in ground water supplies when spilled. This has effectively eliminated its use in the US and Canada.

============ N ============
* N+2A	Also known as: N+A N+2A is a measure of how well a heavy naphtha will perform when fed to a reformer, that is how high the octane of the resulting reformate will be. N+2A is calculated as the volume percent of naphthenes in the naphtha plus 2 times the volume of aromatics. A higher N+2A naphtha will yield a higher octane, higher aromatics content reformate when reformed.
* Naphtha	Naphtha is a broad term referring to distillation fractions and other intermediates in the gasoline boiling range. Typically, naphtha is categorized based on its boiling range as either: Light naphtha - Used as petrochemical feedstock, C5 isomerization feedstock, or directly as a gasoline blendstock Heavy naphtha - Feedstock to the reformer to make reformate for gasoline blending
* Naphtha hydrotreater	The naphtha hydrotreater is a category of hydrotreater that treats heavy naphtha streams, primarily to prepare them as feed to the reformer by removing sulfur and nitrogen.
* Naphthene	Also known as: Cycloparaffin Naphthenes are hydrocarbons containing a saturated carbon ring (as opposed to aromatics, which have an unsaturated carbon ring). Hydrocarbon streams with a high concentration of naphthenes are called naphthenic.
* Natural gas	Natural gas is a gas composed primarily of methane but typically with some ethane as well. Most natural gas comes directly from upstream oil and gas wells, not from refining. In refining, natural gas is often purchased and used as a refinery fuel and as a feedstock to make hydrogen in the hydrogen plant.
* Needle coke	Needle coke is a specialty grade of pet coke valued for its crystalline structure that makes it a good material for making electrodes. Needle coke is typically produced from a dedicated coker that uses low-sulfur FCC slurry as feedstock. The high aromatics content of the FCC slurry results in the desired needle coke properties. Refiners often sell low-sulfur FCC slurry to a third-party needle coker, but there are some refineries with their own on-site dedicated needle coker.
* New York Harbor	New York Harbor is a major refined product spot market trading hub market. Refined product in New York Harbor comes from imports (particularly from Europe), production from nearby refineries around Philadelphia, and up the Colonial pipeline from the Gulf Coast. Most of the major refined products have spot price assessments in the New York Harbor market.
* NGL	Also known as: Natural gas liquid NGLs are liquids separated from natural gas as the gas is processed either in the field or at gathering points before moving to market. NGLs are a mixture of light hydrocarbons including ethane, propane, butane, and light naphtha. The composition of NGLs varies. NGLs are typically transported to a fractionation plant for separation into the different components.
* Nickel	Nickel is a common metal found in trace amounts in crude oil. Nickel is considered a contaminant as it tends to de-activate FCC catalyst if present in FCC feed in very high concentrations.
* Nitrogen	Nitrogen is an important contaminant in crude oil, typically in the form of organic nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen is a poison to many process catalysts and can also contribute to corrosion. Crudes with excessive amounts of nitrogen (greater than ~0.25%) require special processing.
* NOC	Also known as: National Oil Company NOCs are oil companies owned and operated by the government of the country they are in. Many large oil-producing countries have NOCs that control most or all of the oil industry activities in their domestic markets.
* Nomination	A nomination is a request for capacity, typically on a pipeline or for ship loading/unloading facilities. Logistics capacity is typically scheduled by first collecting nominations from interested parties, and then allocating available capacity.
* Nonassociated gas	Nonassociated gas is natural gas that is produced from a natural gas well, rather than an oil well (associated gas).

============ O ============
* Octane	Also known as: RON, DON Octane is one of the most important product qualities for gasoline. Specifically, octane is a measure of the tendency of gasoline to resist auto-igniting when compressed with air in a spark ignition (Otto cycle) engine. In a spark ignition engine, a mixture of gasoline and air is compressed in the engine's combustion chamber, before being ignited by a high-temperature spark. For efficient engine operation, it is important that the gasoline fuel mixture does not ignite before it is fully compressed. However, because compression raises the temperature of the mixture, some hydrocarbons do have a tendency to auto-ignite at the wrong time in the engine cycle. Octane is a measure of a hydrocarbon's resistance to doing this. Higher-octane materials are more valuable to a refiner because they allow the refiner to make higher-octane gasoline, which is priced at a premium. Also, high-octane material can be used to upgrade cheap, low-octane blend stocks and still achieve finished gasoline quality. Refiners have a number of options for producing octane. The most important is the reformer, which significantly raises the octane of heavy naphtha. An octane boost also comes from isomerizing light naphtha. Other sources of medium- to high-octane material are the FCC and the alky unit. High- and low-octane materials Certain chemical structures are associated with high and low octane ratings. Generally speaking, aromatics, olefins, and iso-paraffins (branched paraffins) will have higher octane ratings. Straight-chain paraffins will have lower octane ratings. Molecules containing oxygen, such as alcohols and ethers, will also have higher octane ratings. Consequently, some of the higher-octane gasoline blend stocks are: FCC gasoline from the FCC - High in aromatics and olefins Reformate from the reformer - High in aromatics Alkylate from the alkylation unit - Branched-chain paraffin Isomerate from the isomerization unit - Branched-chain paraffin Ethanol - An alcohol MTBE - An ether Lower-octane gasoline blend stocks are: Hydrocrackate from the hydrocracker - Straight-chain, saturated paraffins Light straight run naphtha - Saturated paraffins Heavy naphtha - Saturated paraffins and naphthenes Measurement of octane rating Octane is measured using an index reflecting the degree to which a fuel will knock under specific operating conditions. The index is defined based on the knocking characteristics of two reference fuels. Iso-octane has a very high resistance to knocking, even at high levels of compression, and is assigned an octane rating of 100. N-heptane has a low resistance to knocking, even at very low levels of compression, and is assigned a rating of 0. Other fuels are assigned an octane rating based on the mixture of iso-octane and n-heptane that results in knocking at the same compression level as the fuel being considered. For example, a fuel that knocks at the same compression level as a mixture of 75% iso-octane mixed with 25% n-heptane would have an octane rating of 75. Because knocking behavior varies with engine operating conditions, there are several different octane scales considered. The two most common are RON (research octane) and MON (motor octane). These are both measured using the same iso-octane and n-heptane based method but under different engine operating conditions. RON conditions are meant to reflect fairly stable cruising conditions. MON conditions are meant to reflect more challenging conditions such as high speeds or pulling a heavy load. As a rough rule, RON is about 10 points higher than MON, for the same fuel. In North America, there is also a third octane index commonly used that is simply an average of RON and MON. This is called DON. AKI or R+M/2.
* Off sites	Off sites are all of the refinery facilities that are not core to process operations but still account for a significant share of refinery investment. Typically this would include utilities (power, water, etc) and infrastructure (roads, buildings, fences, storage facilities, and import and export logistics such as jetties and docks).
* Off spec	A crude oil or refined product cargo is off spec if it does not satisfy the quality requirements set by contract or regulation. Crude cargoes that are off spec are typically dealt with by a price adjustment. Off-spec cargoes or batches of product must be brought back on spec, typically through adding a high-quality blend stock.
* Official selling price	Also known as: OSP An official selling price is an announced price, typically for crude oil, that is offered to all buyers in the market for a set period of time (usually a calendar month). OSPs are typically set using a formula or differential to market benchmarks. 
* Oil sands	Also know as: Tar sands Oil sands are deposits of oil in the form of small amounts of bitumen covering fine grains of sand. Oil sands are an unconventional source of oil production. It requires either mining of the sands and separation of the bitumen using hot water, or injection of steam into the wells in the oil sands deposits to free the bitumen so it can be pumped to the surface.
* Oil Transportation	Crude oil and petroleum products are moved by a variety of means. The most common are: Oil tanker - Ships designed specifically to move liquid hydrocarbons across the ocean Barge - Coast or river barges designed with tanks to hold liquid hydrocarbons and move them through coastal and inland waterways Oil pipeline - Liquids pipelines, usually dedicated to moving either crude oil, finished products, or LPG across land Railcar tanker - Railway cars designed to move either crude oil or light products Tank truck - Trucks designed to move either crude oil or finished light products
* Olefins	Olefins are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a double bond between two carbon atoms. Examples are butylene and propylene. Olefins in finished petroleum products In gasoline, olefins contribute to octane, which is beneficial. However, because they tend to form harmful deposits inside of engines, there are typically limits set on total olefin content. Refinery streams containing high percentages of olefins, such as coker naphtha, have a tendency to polymerize and form gums that can cause problems in storage and transportation systems, so these streams usually are hydrotreated to saturate the olefins Some refineries produce olefins such as propylene as a product, typically as a feedstock to petrochemicals. Olefins in refinery feedstocks In a refinery, olefins are an important feedstock into the alkylation unit to produce alkylate (a high-value gasoline blend stock). The olefins most commonly used in the alkylation unit are butylene and propylene, which primarily come from the FCC unit.
* OPEC	Also known as: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC is the organization that coordinates crude oil production levels for the major crude-exporting countries, in an effort to balance global crude supply and demand to maintain market stability. OPEC members are: Saudi Arabia Iran Venezuela Iraq Nigeria Qatar Indonesia Kuwait Algeria UAE Libya Ecuador Angola Gabon
* Operating costs	Operating costs typically refer to only the non-hydrocarbon costs associated with running the refinery. Refinery costs are typically measured per barrel of crude oil processed. These are typically grouped into fixed and variable categories depending on whether they vary with throughput or not. Fixed costs are any costs that do not vary with the level of throughput at any point in time. Examples are labor and equipment. Fixed costs are typically measured relative to crude processing capacity (e.g., USD/bbl crude distillation capacity). Fixed costs are also frequently subdivided into costs associated with maintaining the refinery (maintenance costs), costs of running the refinery (operating costs), and costs of managing the refinery (supervisory, overhead, support) Variable costs are any costs that vary with the level of refinery throughput. Examples include energy, catalyst, and chemicals. Variable costs are typically measured relative to crude throughput (e.g., USD/bbl crude run or USD/bbl of utilized crude capacity). Generally, all costs are assumed to vary with refinery size and with refinery complexity
* Operations performance	A refinery’s operations performance is typically the one major driver of profitability that is in the refiner’s control. From a refining standpoint, the major areas of refinery operations performance are: Reliability – Reliability is a measure of a refiner’s ability to keep the equipment available for use by maintaining mechanical integrity Operating costs – Operating costs typically refer to the non-hydrocarbon costs associated with running the refinery, including labor, equipment, energy, and catalyst/chemicals Optimization – Optimization is the economic decision-making around which crude to run, which products to make, and how to run the refining units (utilization and severity) to achieve this Yield – Yield is a measure of the outputs achieved (product mix and quality) for a given crude slate. A better yield would be one with more high-valued products (e.g., gasoline and diesel) of higher quality (e.g., high-octane gasoline, high-cetane diesel) Commercial performance – is the effectiveness of sourcing crude and selling products. Good performance entails getting the optimal crude at the lowest possible price and selling the optimal product slate at the highest possible price Capital employed – The capital employed in the refinery primarily consists of capital invested in the plant itself (process units and supporting infrastructure), hydrocarbon inventories (crude and products), and equipment inventories (pumps, valves, etc) Refiners rely heavily on industry benchmarks to gauge their operations performance versus peers and to prioritize areas for improvement.
* Optimization	Also known as: refinery planning Optimization is the process of making near-term commercial decisions around the refinery so as to maximize refinery profitability. The key decisions that the optimization process tends to focus on are: Feedstock selection – This includes decisions around which crude oil grades to buy, what sequence and combinations to run them in, and which intermediates to buy and sell Product slate – This includes decisions around which refined products to make, how much of each product to make, what qualities to make of each product, and what channels to sell the product into (e.g., spot vs term, bulk vs rack vs retail, branded vs unbranded, etc) Refinery scheduling – This includes all major decisions around running the refinery on a day-to-day basis such as utilization rates, cut points, unit severities, and unit modes Product blending – This involves detailing the specific blend recipes for individual batches of products using different available intermediate blend stocks Logistics scheduling – This involves all decisions around when and where to receive incoming crude and intermediate cargoes (by ship, barge, pipe, etc) and when and how to move outgoing shipments of finished product Optimization tools The planning and optimization process uses a number of sophisticated tools to make decisions and to formulate plans for the refinery. The most important are: Refinery linear program (LP model) – The LP is a tool used to find the margin maximizing crude and product slate for a refinery, subject to the market and operational constraints that a refinery faces at a given point in time Refinery scheduling model – The scheduling model translates the high-level plan generated by the LP model into more detailed and actionable daily operating instructions for the refinery. It is a simulation model (not an LP) with much greater granularity and accuracy than the LP, but without the ability to optimize Blending model - The blending model is a specialized LP model focused on optimizing the batch-by-batch blending of finished products using available blend stocks, and seeking to maximize overall product slate value Logistics scheduling models – There are typically a number of detailed logistics scheduling models used to keep track of and to plan for receipts of crude and other feedstocks and outward movements of products Crude cutting tool – This is a support tool used to create the crude assay information that the LP and scheduling models need to run. This model takes a generic laboratory assay and translates it into a format and cutting scheme aligned with refinery operations and the LP and scheduling tool formats Process unit simulators – These are detailed models of individual process units that are used to assess the performance of the unit (yield and product quality) at different feed qualities, utilization rates, and operating conditions. These models help in generating the yield correlations used to represent each unit in the refinery LP and scheduling models
* Option	An option is a contract that allows (but does not require) the buyer of the option to either purchase (call option) or sell (put option) a parcel of crude or product at a specified time in the future at a specified price.
* Over the counter	Also known as: OTC Over-the-counter contracts are custom contracts directly between two counterparties, as opposed to standardized exchange-traded contracts.
* Oxygenate	An oxygenate is a gasoline blend stock containing oxygen that is used to reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide when gasoline is burned. Typically, oxygenates are either ethers or alcohols. The most common oxygenates are: Methanol - Produced from natural gas or coal MTBE - Made from methanol and butylene Ethanol - Made from fermenting agricultural products ETBE - Made from ethanol and butylene In many countries, renewable oxygenates such as ethanol are mandated as part of renewable fuel standards. Also, under the right market conditions, refiners may blend some oxygenates on a purely economic basis as they tend to have relatively high octane levels.

============ P ============
* PADD	Also known as: Petroleum Administration for Defense District PADD is term used to describe different refining regions in the US. The term was created by the US government and is the regional definition used by US government agencies when collecting and publishing industry data. The PADD definitions are: PADD 1 - East Coast PADD 2 - Midwest PADD 3 - Gulf Coast PADD 4 - Mountains PADD 5 - West Coast plus Hawaii and Alaska
* Panama Canal	The Panama Canal is a major oil transit point between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Smaller oil tankers (Panamax class) can transit directly through the canal. Crude oil is also shipped on a pipeline running parallel to the canal.
* Panamax	Panamax refers to a class of oil tanker smaller than Aframax. Panamax tankers are in the range of 60-80 DWT. They are used for crude oil and refined product shipment. If moving product, they are often called LR1. The name comes from the size limit created by the original design of the Panama Canal.
* Paraffin	Paraffins are straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbons (i.e., they do not contain naphthene or aromatic rings). In a refinery, a paraffinic hydrocarbon will tend to crack well in a cracking unit (e.g., FCC) and will have higher cetane when blended into diesel, especially if it contains more straight chains and fewer branches. Likewise, it will tend to perform poorly in a reformer and would make a poor (low-octane) gasoline blendstock.
* Pet coke	Also known as: coke, refinery coke, petroleum coke Pet coke is the solid carbon byproduct of cracking units such as the the FCC and coker unit. In an FCC, coke forms on the catalyst and is burned off as fuel for the FCC process, resulting in no net production of coke as a product. In a delayed coker, resid is thermally cracked to produce lighter, more desirable products. In the process, a significant portion of the feed (~15% of volume) is converted into elemental carbon called petroleum coke. Refiners separate the coke from the other coker products and sell it as a product. The primary end use for pet coke is as a solid fuel, used as a substitute for coal in furnaces and boilers. The value of the coke as a product is typically far below the cost of the crude oil used to produce it.
* Petrochemicals	Petrochemicals generally refers to the petroleum-derived, commodity chemicals used primarily in the production of plastics and fibers. Most of the feedstocks for petrochemicals come from refining and NGL processing, including ethane, propane, butane, naphtha, and aromatics.
* Pipeline	Pipelines are used to transport crude oil, refined products, and some intermediate streams. Pipelines are generally favored for long-distance movements (more than 100 miles) over land, where they have a cost advantage over other land transport such as rail or truck. Pipelines are typically dedicated to moving either crude oil or refined products. However, within these categories, it is common to batch shipments of different types. There are some pipelines that move crude and refined products in the same line.
* Pitch	Pitch is a general term for heavy resid material. It most commonly refers to the resid material produced as a by-product of steam cracking heavy feedstocks, an it is usually blended into residual fuel oil.
* Plantation pipeline	The Plantation pipeline is one of the major refined product pipelines that moves gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from the US Gulf Coast to the Southeast US market. Plantation links the refining capacity in Louisiana (and by other connections the rest of the Gulf Coast) to Southeast US markets, including Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Plantation competes with the Colonial pipeline, which also serves these same markets. Due to the volume of product moved, the pipeline (especially at its Houston origin) is a major point for spot trading of these products, providing the Gulf Coast Pipe price assessment. Description Plantation is owned in partnership by Kinder Morgan (51.2%) and ExxonMobil (48.8%). 700 thousand barrels/day capacity to move gasoline, diesel, heating oil and jet fuel from Baton Rouge to Virginia 130 shipper terminals and 29 delivery terminals across 8 states from Louisiana to Virginia Minimum batch size of 15 thousand barrels for fungible movements and 25 thousand barrels for segregated movement History 1940 - Company founded by four oil companies (Shell, Texaco, Chevron, and Exxon) and construction began 1942 - Pipeline begins operation with a 8" line from Baton Rouge to Greensboro, delivering 48 thousand bpd for four customers 1964 - Extension to Richmond and Alexandria, VA 1968 - Major expansion including increased capacity and new spur lines 1998 - Shell and Texaco (through Equilon JV) sold stake to Kinder Morgan 1999 - Kinder Morgan acquires controlling interest by acquiring Chevron's stake 2004 - Exxon sold seven terminals connected to Plantation to Kinder Morgan 2016 - Kinder Morgan suspends plans to construct a 360-mile line (Palmetto pipeline) connecting the Plantation pipeline to Savannah and Jacksonville Tim Fitzgibbon (12/2018)
* Platts	Platts is one of the major oil price assessment agencies and industry news services for crude oil and refined products (along with Argus). Platts provides daily price assessments for most major crude oil grades around the world and most of the major oil products in big trading hubs such as Northwest Europe, the US Gulf Coast, and Singapore. Platts also publishes newsletters providing market commentary. 
* PNA	PNA is a quality measure for naphtha. Specifically, it is the volumetric % of paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics of the naphtha. It is a good predictor of the quality of reformate that heavy naphtha will yield when sent through a reformer. Variations on PNA include PONA and N+2A.
* Polymer gasoline	Also known as: Poly gasoline Polymer gasoline is a high-octane gasoline blend stock produced by the polymer unit.
* Polymerization unit	Also known as: Polymer unit, Poly A polymerization unit converts propylene and butylene into a gasoline blend stock by joining two olefin molecules to form one larger olefin called polymer gasoline. Polymerization has largely been displanted by alkylation units which have the advantages of using isobutane as well as an olefin (expanding the resulting volume of gasoline) and resulting in a higher quality product. Dimerization is a form of polymerization that uses only propylene as its olefin feed.
* PONA	PONA is a quality measure for naphtha. Specifically, it is the volumetric % of paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics of the naphtha. It is a good predictor of the quality of reformate that the heavy naphtha will yield when sent through a reformer. Variations on PONA include PNA and N+2A.
* Posted price	Posted prices are prices, typically of crude oil, that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at. Posted prices are usually a starting point and reference index for negotiation of final transaction prices.
* Pour point	Pour point is an important quality specification for diesel fuels. Specifically, it is a measure of the tendency of a fuel to become more viscous and resist flowing when cold. Pour point is measured as 5F above the temperature at which a fuel ceases to flow due to the formation of wax crystals that increase its viscosity. Pour point specifications are a maximum allowable temperature. Lower pour point material is more desirable. Generally, light (lower boiling point) material will have a lower (more desirable) pour point.
* PP&E	Also known as: Plant, property, and equipment PP&E refers to the investment made in major hard assets at a refinery, as opposed to capital invested in more liquid assets such as crude oil and refined product inventories.
* Pressure swing adsorption	Also known as: PSA Pressure swing adsorption is a common method for purifying hydrogen in a refinery by removing other hydrocarbon gases. The PSA unit uses a molecular sieve to adsorb hydrocarbons other than hydrogen, resulting in a purified hydrogen stream. Pressure is used to release the adsorbed hydrocarbons once the hydrogen has been separated.
* Price assessment	Price assessment is the determination of the prevailing market price for a crude oil or refined product at a point in time. The most important price assessments are for the spot market for crude oil and products, as these are the best indicators of overall market conditions and are used as the benchmarks for many crude and product transactions. Price assessment is performed by a number of price assessment agencies. The most important being: Platts - Assesses prices for spot trades of most major crude and product grades around the world Argus - Assesses prices for spot trades of most major crude and product grades around the world OPIS - primarily assesses prices for rack (wholesale) and retail product markets These agencies assess and publish prices on a daily basis based on observed transactions and/or player postings. Each has its own method for collecting transaction data, judging which transactions to include, adjusting for differences (e.g., quality, location, deal size), and reporting prices to the market.
* Price assessment agency	Price assessment agencies are organizations that assess the going market price of commodities on a daily basis by surveying market participants and tracking transactions. These agencies publish their daily assessment of prices, and market participants use these assessments to settle contracts tied to market pricing. For crude oil and refined products, the major price assessment agencies are Platts and Argus.
* Prices	Crude oil and petroleum products are priced at all stages of the oil value chain. Major pricing points are: Wellhead price - Price or value of crude oil at the point of production, before any transportation Crude gathering point price - Price of crude at a point where volumes are aggregated for shipping, usually at a seaport or major pipeline injection point Refinery gate price - Price of crude delivered to a refinery, or price of product leaving a refinery Spot market price - Price at the point where large parcel or cargoes physically trade hands Rack price - Price of a truck load of product at a distribution terminal loading facility, known as the loading rack Dealer tankwagon price - Price of a truckload of gasoline or diesel delivered to a fuel retailer Pump price - Price of gasoline or diesel to the retail consumer at a retail filling station. International crude and product transactions are typically in US dollars. Wholesale (rack) prices are typically in the local market currency, as are prices to final consumers. The units for oil trade are typically either USD/barrel or USD/metric ton.
* Price-setting mechanism	A price-setting mechanism refers to how the price of a commodity (or price relationship between multiple commodities) is determined by the market. It is essentially the link between pricing behavior and the underlying physical behavior that affects pricing. Common examples of price-setting mechanisms are: Marginal cost of production Value in use Substitution value (versus alternatives) Import parity pricing Export net-back pricing Price-setting mechanisms can be determined either by market forces or by direct, explicit contract terms.
* Pricing basis	Standard terms for an oil cargo will include specified transportation loading arrangements such as: FOB – Free Onboard. Loaded onto a ship and ready for transport, but not including the costs associated with transport CIF – Cost, Insurance, Freight. Onboard a ship ready for receipt at the delivery point, with the cost of transport already built into the price, including insurance C&F – Cost and Freight. Onboard a ship ready for receipt at the delivery point, with the cost of transport already built into the price, but not including the cost of insurance
* Process units	A refinery is a plant that includes a number of different processing units. Each of these plays a role in the overall process of converting crude oil into finished petroleum products. A typical refinery will have a dozen or more of these processing units. These fall into four broad categories: Separation units - Some process units separate a hydrocarbon mixture into its components through distillation or extraction. The most common separation units are atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation Conversion units - Conversion units take individual hydrocarbon streams and convert them to other hydrocarbons by changing their size and chemical structure. Examples are the coker, FCC, and alkylation unit Treating units - A number of process unites improve a hydrocarbon stream by removing impurities and changing some chemical properties, but without changing the refinery's product yield. Good examples of this are the hydrotreaters Supporting process units - This includes utilities and and other non-hydrocarbon processing units Typical process units in a refinery include: Crude desalting - Removes salt and other contaminants from crude oil before it is sent to atmospheric distillation for separation Atmospheric distillation - The first major process unit in a refinery. Separates crude oil into its component distillation fractions Vacuum distillation - Secondary distillation that separates the heaviest fractions into VGO and vacuum resid Coker - Thermal conversion process that converts the heaviest distillation fraction (vacuum resid) into lighter fractions Visbreaker - Mild thermal conversion process that lower the viscosity of vacuum resid Resid hydrocracker - Catalytic conversion process that converts vacuum resid to lighter fractions while injecting hydrogen RCC - Catalytic cracking process that converts atmospheric resid to lighter fractions; similar to an FCC but with heavier feed De-asphalting - Solvent extraction process that removes asphaltenes from vacuum resid FCC - Catalytic conversion process that converts VGO to lighter fractions Hydrocracker - Catalytic conversion process that converts VGO to lighter fractions (especially distillates) while injecting hydrogen) Thermal cracker - Non-catalytic process for converting VGO to lighter fractions Reformer - Increases the octane value of heavy naphtha Alkylation - Combines light olefins with isobutane to make gasoline Dimersol - Converts propylene into a higher-value gasoline blend stock Polymerization - Converts light olefins into a higher-value gasoline blend stock MTBE ETBE TAME Iso-octene C5/C6 isomerization - Improves the octane value of light naphtha C4 isomerization - Converts butane into isobutane as feed to the alkylation unit Hydrogen production - Generates hydrogen for other process units from methane or other hydrocarbon feedstocks Hydrogen purification - Extracts hydrogen from refinery gas streams Naphtha hydrotreater - Catalytic process to remove sulfur and other contaminants from naphtha by injecting hydrogen Kerosene hydrotreater - Catalytic process to remove sulfur and other contaminants from kerosene by injecting hydrogen Distillate hydrotreater - Catalytic process to remove sulfur and other contaminants from distillate by injecting hydrogen FCC gasoline hydrotreater - Catalytic process to remove sulfur and other contaminants from FCC gasoline by injecting hydrogen VGO hydrotreater - Catalytic process to remove sulfur and other contaminants from VGO by injecting hydrogen Resid hydrotreater - Catalytic process to remove sulfur and other contaminants from resid by injecting hydrogen Asphalt plant - Creates asphalt from vacuum resid Base oil plant - Collection of processes that extracts base oil from VGO and vacuum resid BTX plant - Collection of processes that extracts aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene) from reformate Sat gas plant - Collection of processes that separates components in saturated refinery gas and removes impurities Unsat gas plant - Collection of processes that separate components in unsaturated (cracked) refinery gas and remove impurities Sulfur plant - Converts H2S into solid sulfur Calciner - Processes pet coke for use as a specialty product Acid regeneration Tail gas recovery
* Prompt	A prompt cargo is one for immediate or very near-term physical delivery.
* Propane	Also known as: C3 Propane is the lightest liquid stream produced in a refinery. The propane molecule has three carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. In refining, propane is typically blended into finished products (LPG and propane for petrochemical feed) to make ethylene or propylene. It is also sometimes used as refinery fuel but this is typically its lowest value end use. Propane production Propane comes from many different process units in the refinery, as well as from outside sources such as natural gas plants (from separating NGLs). Major sources inside the refinery include: Atmospheric distillation - All crude oil yields some amount of propane when distilled. Typically, it leaves the distillation tower in a wet gas stream that is sent to the saturated gas plant for separation from lighter gases (methane and ethane) that are then used for fuel FCC - In the FCC conversion process, large amounts of C3s are produced, including both saturated propane and unsaturated propylene. Often the unsaturated olefins are separated for use as feed to the alkylation unit Coker - Similar to the FCC, the coker conversion process generates mixed C3s containing saturated and unsaturated molecules. However, it is less common for coker C3s to have their olefins separated out Reformer - Reformers will yield approximately 5% (by volume) of C3s in the conversion process.
* Propylene	Also known as: Propene, C3= Propylene is a three-carbon olefin, basically propane with one double bond. In a refinery, propane is important as a feedstock to the alky unit to make C3 alkylate for blending into gasoline. Propylene is also often separated and sold as a feedstock to the petrochemicals industry to make polypropylene plastics. Refinery propylene primarily comes from the FCC unit. Small amounts of propylene are also produced from other cracking units, such as the coker, but these are less likely to be separated for use in the alky. Propylene can also be produced on purpose by dehydrogenating propane, but this is not typically done in a refinery. In the absence of an alky unit, the typical disposition of propylene is in LPG blending or refinery fuel, both very low-value options.
* Pump price	Also known as: Street price, retail price Pump price refers the retail price that consumers actually see and pay when purchasing fuel at a retail station. Typically this includes all of the cost of supply, including margin for the retailer and taxes.
* Put option	A put option is a forward contract that allows the buyer to sell a commodity in the future at a designated price, in exchange for paying a premium. A put option is essentially a bet that the actual market price in the future will be below the designated price (minus the cost of the premium).
* Pyrolysis gasoline	Also known as: Pygas Pygas is a highly aromatic naphtha range intermediate produced as a by-product of making ethylene in a steam cracker. Pygas can be used as a high-octane gasoline blend stock or as a source of aromatics for BTX extraction.

============ Q ============
* Qualities (crude)	Different crude oil grades are valued differently by refiners based on their crude qualities. There are a large number of different qualities that affect how a refiner will value an individual crude grade. Crude qualities fall into two categories: whole crude qualities and crude fraction or cut-specific properties. Whole crude properties: API gravity - Also known as density, which is an indicator of the composition of the crude and gives a rough idea of the ratio of different distillation cuts that will result from processing the crude. Generally a lighter, higher API crude is more desirable Sulfur content - How sweet or sour the crude is. Sulfur is an undesirable contaminant, so lower sulfur is more desirable. Typically measured in wt % Acid number - Also known as TAN, a measure of how corrosive the crude will be when processed. Lower acid is less corrosive and more desirable. Typically measured in Mg KOH/gram of oil required for neutralization Nitrogen - Nitrogen is a contaminant that can be harmful to the catalysts used in some conversion processes. Typically measured in wt ppm Viscosity - A liquid's resistance to flow at a specific temperature. Higher viscosity ("thicker") crudes are more difficult to pump and less desirable. Typically measured in centistokes (cst) at 20C or 77F Pour point - Similar to viscosity, specifically the lowest temperature at which a liquid shows signs of fluid movement. Measured in degrees (C or F) Mercaptan - A specific form of sulfur that produces an undesirable smell at even very low concentration. Measured in ppm wt H2S - A sulfur gas that is highly toxic in even small concentrations. Measured in ppm wt Metals - Trace amounts of metals that can harm sensitive catalysts. Typically include nickel, vanadium, iron, and mercury. Measured in ppm weight Organic chlorides - Measured in ppm Fraction-specific qualities apply only to individual crude fractions or cuts. Which properties are measured depend on the specific fraction or cut and how it is used in either further processing or direct blending into a finished product.   

============ R ============
* Rack	Also known as: truck rack, terminal rack The rack is the loading facility for tank wagons at a fuel terminal. The rack is made up of pipes suspended on a pipe rack (hence the name) connected to the terminal's fuel storage tanks. Tank trucks pull under the rack and are filled from above with fuel. The rack price is a key pricing point in the refined product supply chain, reflecting pricing at the point where fuel has been loaded onto a truck and is ready for final delivery.
* Rack price	The rack price for refined product is one of the key wholesale price points in the fuel supply chain. The rack price is the price of gasoline or diesel, loaded onto a truck at the distribution terminal, ready for delivery to end users or retail stations. The rack price embeds all of the costs and margins of supplying fuel from the terminal, including terminal fees, final blending with ethanol (if done), cost of additive packages, and contract premiums/discounts specific to individual supply contracts (e.g., branded vs unbranded).
* RBOB	RBOB is a common grade of gasoline produced by refiners in the US. It gets its name from being a reformulated grade of gasoline ("R") that has tighter environmental specifications than conventional gasoline, and its use is mandated in many urban areas with air quality issues. RBOB is a "BOB" (before oxygenate blending) because it is formulated for subsequent blending with 10% ethanol to form the final gasoline blend that is marketed to end users.
* RCC	Also known as: Resid catalytic cracker The RCC is a variation of the FCC unit that is capable of taking heavier feed. The RCC takes atmospheric resid and VGO and cracks them using heat in the presence of a catalyst. The primary product is FCC gasoline, which is used in gasoline product blending. However, the RCC also produces lighter products that feed the alkylation unit and heavier products that can be blended into diesel and residual fuel oil. The RCC is particularly valuable in a refinery that is trying to maximize gasoline production over residual fuel oil. The RCC yields a high volume of gasoline of pretty good quality (high-octane and low vapor pressure). However, its volume yield of diesel is low and of low quality (low-cetane), since it is made up of cracked material, which tends to have low cetane. How it works Heated feed is mixed with a heated catalyst and injected into a reactor, where the catalyst freely mixes with the feed as a fluid. As the feed is cracked, coke deposits on the catalyst, causing it to gradually deactivate. Cracked product is drawn off at the top of the reactor and is sent to a fractionator. Deactivated catalyst is drawn off the bottom of the reactor and is sent to a regenerator where the coke is burned off by injecting heat and air. The cleaned (regenerated) catalyst is then sent back to the reactor, and the cycle repeats. Inputs The feed to the RCC includes streams that would otherwise be blended into fuel oil. Typical feeds include: Atmospheric resid - The bottoms from the atmospheric distillation tower, containing a mix of VGO and vacuum resid. Typically, the RCC uses atmospheric resid from a light, sweet crude or atmospheric resid that has been hydrotreated VGO - This heavy cut from the vacuum distillation is sometimes added to the RCC feed to increase throughput Coker gasoil - For refineries with a coker, this VGO range material from that unit is also a major feedstock for the RCC Products The RCC produces a range of mostly lighter products, with the most significant being FCC gasoline. Typical products are: FCC gasoline - This is a naphtha boiling range material with octane and vapor pressure close to the quality specifications for finished gasoline. This is typically the largest product at around 50% of FCC output Cycle oils - The FCC produces a diesel range product called cycle oil. This is highly aromatic and often high in sulfur, which makes it a poor diesel blend stock. It is typically blended into lower quality diesel, used as a cutter stock in fuel oil blending, or sent to the hydrocracker for upgrading FCC slurry - The heaviest product from the the RCC is a highly aromatic resid stream, typically with high sulfur content. This is usually sent to fuel oil blending, used as feed for the coker, or used to make specialty products such as carbon black or needle coke FCC gas - The light ends from the RCC include both saturated and unsaturated C3s and C4s. This is typically sent to an unsaturated gas plant where the components are separated. The butylenes, and sometimes the propylenes, are fed to the alkyaltion unit if there is one. Lighter gases (ethane and methane) are sent to the refinery fuel system
* Reactor	The reactor is the part of a conversion process unit where the chemical reaction takes place. In most processes, this is a vessel designed specifically to house the reaction.
* Recycle	Recycle is unconverted feedstock coming out of a conversion unit that is fed back into the unit as feed to increase yield (at the expense of fresh feed throughput).
* Refined products	Also known as: petroleum products, oil products, finished products Petroleum products are the outputs of a petroleum refinery. A typical refinery produces a wide variety of different products from every barrel of crude oil that it processes. Generally, refineries operate to make as much of the high-value light products (gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel) that they can, with the other products acting essentially as by-products. Some of the major products from a typical refinery are: Propane - Used as a feedstock for ethylene cracking, or blended into LPG for uses as a fuel Butane - Used as a feedstock for ethylene cracking, or blended into LPG for uses as a fuel LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) - A blend of propane and butane used as fuel Light naphtha - Used as feedstock into ethylene crackers Gasoline - Used as a transportation fuel for passenger cars and light trucks Aviation gasoline - Used as an engine fuel in light aircraft Jet fuel - Used as a fuel for jet aircraft Kerosene fuel oil - Used as a residential cooking, heating, and lighting fuel Diesel - Used as a fuel for heavy-duty trucks, trains, and heavy equipment Industrial gasoil - Used as a furnace fuel in industrial plants and commercial/residential heating (heating oil) Residual fuel oil - Used as a fuel in power generation and for large ocean-going ships (bunker fuel) Many refineries also produce specialty or non-fuel products such as: Asphalt - Used to pave roads and in the manufacture of building materials (e.g., roof shingles) Base oils - Used to make lubricating oils for use in industrial machinery and vehicle engines Propylene - Can be separated for sale to the petrochemicals industry Aromatics - Can be separated from reformate for sale to the petrochemicals industry Wax - Extracted from lubricating oil and either sold as a feedstock to specialty wax production (as slackwax) or treated at the refinery to a finished wax product. Grease - Used as a solid lubricating oil, mostly in industrial uses White oil - A colorless, odorless, tasteless oil used by the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals industries White spirit - Naphtha range material used as an industrial or household solvent Sulfur - A contaminant when present in other products, but once separated, it can be sold as a feedstock to the petrochemicals industry Pet coke - A by-product of the coking process that can be sold as a fuel for power plants and cement plants or to manufacture electrodes and anodes
* Refinery fuel	Refinery fuel refers to all of the fuel used within a refinery to feed furnaces and provide heat to process units. Most of the process units in a refinery require the input of heat either from a furnace in the process unit, or from heat generated in furnaces elsewhere in the plant and sent the unit in the form of steam. The fuel used in the furnaces typically includes all of the refinery gas generated in the refinery, supplemented with either purchased natural gas or low-value intermediates (propane or resid) generated in the refining process.
* Refinery gas	Also known as: Fuel gas Refinery gas refers to the lightest hydrocarbon stream produced from refinery process units. It is typically made of methane and ethane, cut can also have some propane, butane, and hydrogen in it. Refinery gas is typically consumed in the refinery as fuel. Rarely would a refinery sell refinery gas as a finished product.
* Refinery gate	Refinery gate is a commercial term referring to the point of delivery into or out of the refinery. A refinery gate price for crude oil would be delivered to the refinery. A refinery gate price for refined product would be at the refinery, ready for shipment.
* Refinery list	There were over 600 operating refineries around the world as of the beginning of 2017. Below are lists of operating refineries by geography, including owner and capacity: Canada United States Latin America Europe Africa Middle East Former Soviet Union South Asia Southeast Asia and Pacific (including Australia) Northeast Asia
* Refining	A petroleum refinery is a processing plant that converts crude oil into a mix of different finished petroleum products. The profitability of a refinery comes from the difference in value between the crude oil that it processes and the petroleum products that it produces. Most of a refiner's margin comes from the higher-value "light products" (i.e., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) that it makes. However, refineries also, unavoidably, produce some lower-value products (such as fuel oil) in the process. Some refineries also generate incremental value from producing some small-volume specialty products. To increase their margins, many refineries have invested in conversion units to increase their ability to run cheaper, low-quality crudes and/or to increase their yield of high value products. However, this comes at a high capital cost. There are currently over 600 operating refineries in the world, operated by over 200 refining companies. How a refinery works There are four main steps in the oil refining process. The most basic and common step is distillation, where crude oil is separated into its component parts or distillation cuts. This is typically done in a two-stage process: atmospheric distillation then vacuum distillation Next, these distillation cuts are further processed through conversion units to transform them into a more profitable mix of products. A typical refinery has 5-10 different conversion units, such as an FCC or coker. These allow the refinery to produce a mix of petroleum products that is more valuable than the mix that occurs naturally in crude oil. Many of the outputs from one conversion unit are also then fed into another conversion unit Next, refiners employ treating units such as hydrotreaters to improve stream qualities and to remove contaminants Finally, refiners blend different streams to create batches of finished refined products meeting the exact quality specifications that the market wants
* Refining companies	Below is a list of the major refining companies around the world, in rank order based on their ownership of total refining distillation capacity as of the beginning of 2020. Refiners with partial ownership of a refinery are credited with capacity in proportion to their ownership.
* Reformate	Also known as: platformate Reformate is the primary output of the catalytic reformer. The primary use of reformate is as a high-octane blend stock for making gasoline. Reformate's high octane comes from the high levels of aromatics that it contains. Another use of reformate is as a source of aromatics for the petrochemicals industry.
* Reformer	Also known as: platformer, hydroskimmer, CRU, CCR, SCR, powerformer, ultraformer, magnaformer, rhenifomer The purpose of the reformer is to upgrade heavy naphtha into a high-value gasoline blend stock by raising its octane. The primary product of the reformer is reformate. However, it also generates large amounts of hydrogen that can be used in the hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers. Reformers are sometimes called hydroskimmers because of the hydrogen they produce (skim off). The reformer is a critical unit for making high-quality gasoline and avoiding production of low-octane heavy naphtha. Also, as sulfur specifications have tightened, forcing greater use of hydrotreating, the value of the hydrogen produced by the reformer has increased. The reformate from reforming is also the primary source of aromatics (such as benzene, toluene, and xylene) that are used as petrochemicals feedstocks. Reformers are split into two main types of technologies: SR reformer - Older units mostly have fixed beds of catalyst that need to be regenerated every few months by burning off the coke that forms on the catalyst during normal operation. These semi-regen (SR) reformers typically operate at relatively high reactor circuit pressures to minimize the amount of coke formation and to extend the periods between regeneration shutdowns as long as possible, but as a result they only achieve octane numbers of 95-98 in the reformate product CCR - Newer reformers are built with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) capability, so they can operate at lower reactor circuit pressures with higher coke make, as the coked up catalyst is moved continuously to a regenerator section where the coke is burned off the catalyst before it is returned to the reactor section. CCR reformers can often operate for three or more years continuously between turnarounds and can produce reformate product with octane numbers of 101-103 How it works The first step is to hydrotreat the heavy naphtha feed to remove impurities such as sulfur and nitrogen that would be harmful for the reformer's platinum catalysts. This is done in a naphtha hydrotreater that may be considered part of the reformer, or a separate process unit. Next, the feed is sent through a series of 3-4 reactor vessels. Each reactor vessel contains a platinum and alumina catalyst to drive the reaction. Also, for each reactor there is a furnace to inject additional heat as the reaction is endothermic. The product from the reformer (reformate) is a highly aromatic naphtha-range stream, as well as some by-product lighter material and hydrogen. Inputs The input to the reformer is a hydrotreated, high N+A naphtha. This can come from several sources: Straight run heavy naphtha - Produced in the atmospheric distillation of crude and sent through a naphtha hydrotreater Hydrotreated cracked naphtha - From the coker or visbreaker, and sent through the naphtha hydrotreater Heavy hydrocrackate - A heavy naphtha stream produced by the hydrocracker Outputs The major products from the reformer are: Reformate - This is an aromatics-rich naphtha range material that is either blended into gasoline or separated into component aromatic streams that are sold as petrochemicals feedstocks Hydrogen - This is purified and used as feed to hydrotreaters or hydrocrackers Reformer gas - This mixture of refinery gas and light liquids is sent to the gas plant for separation Technology licensors Most new units employ either the UOP or Axens CCR technology. However, there are a large number of existing older units employing other technologies. UOP - Platforming CCR technology Axens/IFP - Octanizing CCR technology ExxonMobil - Powerforming cyclic reforming technology BP/Amoco - Ultraforming semi-regen technology Chevron - Rheniforming semi-regen technology
* Reformulated gasoline	Also known as: RFG Reformulated gasoline is the gasoline grade in the US required in many urban areas with poor air quality.
* Reliablity	Reliability is a measure of a refiner’s ability to keep the equipment available for use by maintaining mechanical integrity. In general, this means minimizing the time that process units are out of service, especially from unplanned outages. The primary measures of reliability are: Mechanical availability – This is a measure of the proportion of time that a process unit is mechanically capable of running (irrespective of whether it actually is running). Generally, this is measured as a percent of unit capacity Unplanned downtime – This is a measure of either the frequency or duration of unit outages. For example, 3 times per year or 20% of the time
* Renewable fuels standard	Also known as: RFS The RFS is the regulation in the US mandating the use of renewable fuels (e.g., ethanol and biodiesel) in domestic fuel. The RFS is administered by the EPA, which defines the regulations for compliance and sets the annual mandate levels for various classes of renewable fuels. The RFS uses RINs (renewable identification numbers) to measure and record compliance. RINS are created when renewable fuels are blended into the fuel supply, can be traded once created, and must be submitted to the EPA by refiners and importers of fuel to meet their compliance obligation under the RFS. 
* Resid	Resid is a very broad term used to refer to a range of intermediate streams and finished petroleum products. Intermediates referred to as resid are generally the bottoms from distillation units: Atmospheric resid - The bottoms from the atmospheric distillation tower Vacuum resid (VR) - The bottoms from vacuum distillation and typically the heaviest intermediate stream in the refinery The finished product typically referred to as resid is heavy fuel oil.
* Resid hydrocracker	Also known as: RHCU, H-Oil, LC-Fining, Hycon The resid hydrocracker upgrades vacuum resid through cracking while injecting hydrogen. This yields a high volume of high-quality diesel and kerosene product. It is similar to the more common gasoil hydrocracker, except that it is capable of running a heavier feed and is more expensive to build and complex to operate. The resid hydrocracker is particularly valuable in a refinery that is trying to maximize diesel production and reduce residual fuel oil. The resid hydrocracker yields a high volume of kerosene and light gasoil (distillate) of good quality (high cetane and low sulfur). However, its volume yield of naphtha is low and of low quality (low N+A). Also, it yields some heavy product (VGO and vac resid range) that must be further processed (FCC or coker) or blended into fuel oil. How it works A mixture of hydrocarbon feed and hydrogen is heated and injected into a series of vessels containing a hydrotreating catalyst. The catalyst in the first reactor typically removes metals, and subsequent reactors have catalysts to remove sulfur. The resulting mix of converted and unconverted hydrocarbon is then separated. Unconverted hydrocarbon can then be recycled to the hydrocracking step for further conversion, sent to a second hydrocracking vessel, or sent to another conversion unit as feed (e.g., an FCC). Products A resid hydrocracker can produce a wide range of products depending upon what feed it processes and how it is designed and operated. Typical products are: Hydrocracked distillate - This is a high-quality diesel blend stock (high cetane and low sulfur) Hydrocracked kerosene - This is a high-quality jet fuel (or diesel) blend stock with low sulfur and high smoke point Heavy hydrocrackate - This is a good-quality reformer feed, with moderate N+A and low sulfur Light hydrocrackate- This is a low-quality gasoline blend stock with low octane but also low sulfur Isobutane - This is valuable in a refinery with an alkylation unit that requires isobutane as a feedstock Hydrocracked vacuum gasoil - A low-sulfur VGO range material that makes a good FCC feed Hydrocracked vacuum resid - A low-sulfur vac resid material that can be sent to a coker for further conversion or blended into fuel oil. Frequently, this is recycled back into the resid hydrocracker to drive higher overall yield
* Resid hydrotreater	Also known as: Resid desulfurization unit, Atmospheric resid desulfurization, ARDS The resid hydrotreater is used to lower the sulfur content of resid streams. This is done either to create lower-sulfur blend stocks for making residual fuel oil or to prepare atmospheric resid for feed into the RCC unit.
* Residual fuel oil	Also known as: resid, No. 6 fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, 6 oil Residual fuel oil is one of the lowest-value petroleum products from a refinery. It is essentially a by-product of producing the light products that are the primary focus of a refinery. The primary end use for residual fuel oil is as a fuel in simple furnaces such as power plants and industrial boilers. It is also the primary fuel used on ocean-going ships, where it is called bunker fuel. Nonetheless, residual fuel oil has some quality specifications that it must meet, for performance and environmental reasons. The most important are: Viscosity - This is a measure of a fluid's tendency to resist flow. Lower viscosity is more desirable Sulfur content - Fuel oil has a maximum sulfur content determined by environmental concerns. This is typically set as a maximum sulfur content in wt %. Residual fuel oil is the heaviest among a range of different fuel oil grades.
* Return	Also known as: ROIC, ROCE A refinery's return on investment is a measure of profitability of the refinery relative to the amount of capital tied up in it. Refineries are very capital-intensive businesses and require high operating profits to earn a reasonable return on capital.
* RIN	Also known as: Renewable identification number RINs are the credits that the US EPA uses to track and enforce compliance with the renewable fuels mandates set by the RFS in the US. RINs are essentially records of individual batches of renewable fuel being blended into the US gasoline and diesel pools. RINs are created when a batch of renewable fuel is made. Each batch receives a unique identification number (hence the name). RINs become usable as credits ("released") once the renewable fuel is blended into gasoline or diesel in the US. Once released, RINs can be traded. Refiners and fuel importers in the US are required to provide the EPA with RINs every year based on the volume of gasoline and diesel that they supply into the US market. They largely get these RINs by buying them from the blenders who release them as blending occurs. The RIN obligation is set each year by the EPA based on an estimate of what US fuel demand will be and a target for renewables use as a share of demand. The obligation is published as the number of RINs that are required for each gallon of fuel supplied by refiners and importers. There are four different types of RINs that are required for every gallon of fuel supplied. These are: Renewable fuel RIN (D6) - These are the most basic RINs and have the highest volume mandate. This RIN is generated by blending corn-based ethanol into gasoline Advanced biofuel RIN (D5) - These RINs are created by blending sugar-cane based ethanol, biobutanol or bionaphtha into gasoline Biomass based diesel RIN (D4)- These RINs are created by blending diesel made from soybean oil, canola oil, waste oil or animal fats into diesel Cellulosic biofuel RIN (D3) - These RINs are generated by blending ethanol made from cellosic material (eg corn stover, wood chips, miscanthus, biogas) into gasoline. Due to the lack of enough cellulosic biofuel, the EPA is able to sell credits to the industry to satisfy this RIN obligation (when matched with a D5 advanced RIN) The four RIN requirements are "nested" meaning the more advanced RINs count against compliance for less advanced RINs: D3 counts against compliance for D5 and D6 D4 counts against compliance for D5 and D6 D5 counts against compliance for D6
* RON	Also known as: Research octane RON is one of the two primary measures of the octane value of gasoline or a gasoline blend stock. RON is a measure of octane value under steady engine operation, such as cruising at constant speed.

============ S ============
* Salt	Crude oil often contains salts that can result in corrosion when processed through a refinery. Salt in crude oil is typically in the form of salt crystals dissolved in the water that is emulsified in the crude oil. The most common salts are chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Salts are typically removed in a desalting unit before crude is sent to atmospheric distillation. High concentrations of salt in a crude oil grade will affect its market value because of the additional cost of processing it.
* Salt dome	A salt dome a is a geologic structure consisting of a deep layer of pure salt. Salt domes are used for crude oil and refined product storage by hollowing out a cavity in the salt structure (by pumping water into it) and filling the space with crude or product.
* Saturated	A saturated hydrocarbon molecule is one that has only single bonds.
* Saturated gas	Also known as: sat gas Saturated gas is refinery gas that contains only saturated molecules (no olefins). This is refinery gas primarily from distillation units. Saturated gas will be processed through the sat gas plant, keeping it separated from unsaturated gas.
* SCF	Also known as: standard cubic foot SCF is a common measure of volume for a gas such as natural gas or hydrogen.
* Scheduling	Scheduling is the part of the refinery planning process focused on translating the monthly plan into much specific, day-by-day, operating instructions for the refinery. Scheduling is typically done using one or a number of scheduling tools that simulate operations down to individual tanks and pipe flows.
* SCOT	Also known as: Shell Claus Off-gas Treatment The SCOT unit is a process that treats the off-gas from the sulfur recovery unit (Claus) to remove residual amounts of sulfur-containing hydrocarbons. In the SCOT unit, tail gas from the Claus unit is combined with hydrogen at high temperatures to convert all sulfur to H2S. The H2S is then extracted using an amine solvent and sent to the Claus unit.
* SDA	Also known as: Solvent deasphalting, Demex, ROSE, Residual oil supercritical extraction The SDA unit removes asphaltenes from vacuum resid, producing an asphalt product and a de-asphalted oil that can be used for base oil manufacturing or FCC feed. Extraction is done using a light hydrocarbon, such as propane or butane, and it is done in stages to remove asphaltenes and resins separately. By varying temperature, extraction can be done selectively, separating asphaltenes and resins from the resid and from each other by taking advantage of their different supercritical temperatures (temperature at which they precipitate out of solution). There are two common processes licensed by UOP (DEMEX) and Kerr McGee (ROSE).
* SECA	Also known as: Sulfur Emission Control Areas SECAs are regions of the world where the International Marine Organization has established special low sulfur emission limits for ships. Current SECAs cover the coastal areas of Europe and North America and limit sulfur content in marine fuels (or equivalent emissions) to less than 0.1% sulfur.
* Selectivity	Selectivity of a catalyst is a measure of its ability to achieve the desired yield of products. For example, an FCC catalyst with high gasoline selectivity will yield more FCC gasoline.
* Separation processes	Separation process units are used to separate a hydrocarbon stream into its components without changing molecule size and structure. This is typically done by either distilling the feed to separate components based on their different boiling points, or by extracting one set of components from the rest based on their different solubilities in a solvent stream. Some of the major separations processes are: Atmospheric distillation tower - Separates crude oil into its components based on their different boiling points Vacuum distillation tower - Separates atmospheric bottoms into its components based on their different boiling points Fractionator - Separates the outputs from a conversion unit into its components based on their boiling points. Included as a part of many conversion units Solvent de-asphalting - Separates asphaltenes from vac resid using a solvent Base oil aromatics extraction - A series of extraction processes to separate base oil from VGO or vac resid BTX extraction - Extracts aromatics from reformate using a solvent Crude desalting - Extracts liquid salts from crude using water (as a solvent)
* Short residue	Also known as: vacuum resid Short residue is the the residue from the vacuum distillation unit. This is in contrast to long residue, which is the residue from atmospheric distillation (atmospheric bottoms). 
* Shot coke	Shot coke is an undesirable grade of pet coke sometimes produced from a delayed coker. The irregular structure of shot coke makes it difficult to handle and unacceptable for any specialty coke uses (relative to the more desirable sponge coke). Refiners try to avoid the production of shot coke by controlling the quality of the vacuum resid feed to the coker.
* Simple capacity	Simple capacity is refining capacity that includes little or no conversion capacity.
* Singapore	Singapore is a major refining center in Asia and main spot market trading hub for the region. Singapore has several large, complex refineries that give it capacity well beyond the needs for the small local market. This capacity acts as swing capacity for the rest of Asia. The spot market in Singapore is deep and active due to the high volume of refined products exported and the number of players producing and buying refined product cargoes.
* Slack wax	Slack wax is unconverted VGO boiling range material from a hydrocracker. This is highly saturated heavy material that can be used as feed to an FCC or as feed to a gasoil steam cracker.
* Smoke point	Smoke point is an important product quality specification for jet fuel and other grades of kerosene. Specifically, it is a measure of a fuel's tendency to generate smoke when burned. This is caused by the formation of carbonaceous particles that do not completely combust. These are a concern both because of their effect on the environment and on the engine. The measure for smoke point is set by the flame height at which smoke begins to form when a fuel is burned in a standardized test burner. Higher smoke point material is more desirable. The primary driver of low smoke point is the presence of aromatics or naphthalenes.
* Soaker	Also known as: Soaking drum A soaker is a drum placed at the front of a visbreaker unit to increase reaction time and reduce reaction temperature.
* Solomon Associates	Solomon is the primary provider of operations benchmarking for the global refinery business. Solomon runs a benchmarking survey globally every two years for refiners as a subscription service. The benchmarks provide a comparison of individual refinery performance on hundreds of different operations metrics, relative an array of different peer groups across different geographies, configurations, and performance levels.
* Solvent	Solvent refers to both a class of specialty refined products and hydrocarbon streams that are used in extraction processes in the refinery.
* Solvent extraction	Solvent extraction is any process that uses a solvent to selectively extract a component from a mixture, based on differences in solubility of the mixture's different components.
* Sour	Also known as: high sulfur In refining, a crude oil grade is called sour if it has a high sulfur content. As opposed to a sweet crude, which is one with a very low sulfur content. Typically, a sour crude would be one with anything over 1% sulfur content, by weight.

* SOx	Also known as: sulfur oxides Sulfur oxides or SOx are compounds formed by the reaction of sulfur with oxygen when a sulfur-containing hydrocarbon is burned. SOx emissions are a source of air pollution and are regulated in most markets. SOx emission from most refined products are controlled by the maximum sulfur limit placed on the fuel. In places where large volumes of fuel are burned (e.g., power plants), scrubbers can be used to remove SOx from the combustion gases after burning, allowing use of higher-sulfur fuel.
* Specialty products	Specialty products are smaller volume, typically industrial products made by the refinery. Usually, high margins are required to justify the expense of making them in small volumes. Examples include: White spirit White oils Waxes Base oils
* Specific gravity	Also known as: SPG Specific gravity is an index used to measure the density of a liquid. Specific gravity is calculated as the ratio of the density of a liquid to the density of water. So any liquid with a density greater than water has a specific gravity greater than 1. Liquids with a density lower than water, which includes most crude oil grades and petroleum products, will have a specific gravity between 0.0 and 1.0. In the oil industry, specific gravity is a common quality specification for finished products. However, for crude oil grades, the API gravity index is more commonly used. Calculation of specific gravity from API gravity: Specific gravity = 141.5/(API gravity + 131.5)
* Spent catalyst	Also known as: Deactivated catalyst Spent catalyst is a catalyst that has lost its ability to catalyze the desired reaction. Most catalysts deactivate over long periods of use and must either be regenerated or replaced.
* Spheroid tank	Spheroid tanks are refined product storage tanks with a spherical shape. These are used to store very light products such as ethane and ethylene.
* Sponge coke	Sponge coke is the typical grade of pet coke produced by a delayed coker. A more atypical and less desirable grade is shot coke, which is harder to handle and not suitable for any specialty coke uses.
* Spot charter	A spot charter is a one-off chartering of a tanker for a single voyage. This is in contrast to a time charter, which is for an extended period of time including multiple voyages.
* Spot market	The spot market for crude oil and refined products refers to the trade of large physical cargoes or parcels in one-off transactions for near-term delivery. While this market accounts for a small portion of overall crude and products transactions, it plays a critical role in setting prices for most other transactions. Most buying and selling of crude and products happens under term contracts. However, most of these contracts rely on the pricing reported in the spot market as the basis for their pricing. The buyers and sellers in the spot market are primarily crude producers, refiners, professional trading firms, and large distributors or consumers of oil products (e.g., large fuel retailers, airlines, fuel wholesalers). Trades are typically done through direct one-to-one interaction of traders by phone, text, or through online exchanges. While the transactions are one-off deals, they tend to be highly standardized in terms of: Location – Where the cargo or shipment will physically change hands Cargo shipping basis – FOB, CIF Mode of oil transportation – A tanker cargo, a barge load, or a pipeline shipment Deal timing window – Period in which the transaction must be completed Prices for these trades are assessed by third-party price assessment agencies (Platts, Argus) and are generally published as a daily spot price assessment. These published spot prices are the basis that most term contract prices are indexed to. Spot transactions are for exchange of physical crude or product volumes at specific location. Crude transactions are typically at the point of loading onto a tanker or into a pipeline near the production region (FOB). Product transactions are typically at a major refining or transportation hub. Examples include: US Gulf Coast – Centered around the Houston refining center, and sometimes including New Orleans, Corpus Christi, Lake Charles, and Beaumont/Port Arthur NWE (Northwest Europe) – Centered around the port of Rotterdam, and sometimes including Amsterdam and Antwerp (called ARA) Singapore New York Harbor - In or near the port of New York and New Jersey Mediterranean – Including the ports of Genoa (Italy) or Lavera (France)
* SR reformer	Also known as: semi-regen reformer The SR reformer is a type of reformer that has to be taken out of operation in order to regenerate the catalyst when its activity declines. This is in contrast to a continuous catalytic reformer (CCR) in which the catalyst is continuously withdrawn, regenerated, and fed back into the unit, keeping activity high.
* Steam cracker	Also known as: ethylene cracker, olefin cracker A steam cracker is a petrochemical plant that cracks light hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, and light naphtha to produce ethylene.
* Steam methane reforming	Also known as: SMR SMR is a technology commonly used to produce hydrogen in a refinery. The SMR process uses steam and a catalyst to make hydrogen from a light hydrocarbon such as methane or propane. The process basically strips the hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and from the water necessary to convert all of the resulting carbon and oxygen to CO2.
* Steam plant	The steam plant in a refinery generates the process steam using boilers fired by natural gas or resid.
* Straight chain	Straight-chain hydrocarbons are ones without either branches or rings.
* Straight run	Straight run refers to any refining stream that comes directly from distillation without any further processing or conversion.
* Stream day	Stream day is a method of defining a refinery or process unit's processing capacity. Stream day considers the maximum throughput that a plant can achieve for a single day, ignoring any slow downs or outages for maintenance or operational considerations. This is in contrast to calendar day, which factors in typical limitations on throughput to give a more accurate indicator of expected average available capacity over an extended period of time.
* Suez Canal	The Suez Canal is a major transportation corridor for both crude oil and refined products, connecting the Mediterranean with Asian markets.
* Suezmax	Suezmax refers to a class of medium-sized oil tanker, larger than Aframax and smaller than VLCC. Suezmax tankers are in the range of 120-180 DWT. They are used mostly for crude oil shipping but can also handle dirty products (residual fuel oil). Suezmax crude tankers are typically used on long-haul routes. Suezmax gets its name from being the largest tanker capable of going through the Suez Canal.
* Sulfolane	The sulfolane process is an extraction process for separating aromatics from reformate. Sulfolane (tetrahydrothiophene 1-1 dioxide) is the solvent used in the process.
* Sulfur (content)	Also known as: Sulphur content Sulfur is an element commonly found in crude oil and petroleum products. Sulfur is considered an undesirable contaminant because, when burned, it generates sulfur oxides. Consequently, most finished petroleum products have a limit on how much sulfur they can contain, making sulfur removal an important part of the overall refinery process. Sulfur can also harm some of the catalysts used in refining process units so it must be removed from some intermediate streams before they can be fed to a conversion unit. As a general rule, a crude oil grade with high sulfur content will have a lower value. This type of crude is often referred to as a sour crude. Most of the sulfur in crude oil is removed during processing. Some of it is removed in conversion processes as hydrocarbon molecules that contain sulfur are cracked and form H2S. Sulfur is also removed directly by processing a hydrocarbon stream through hydrotreating, where the sulfur in the hydrocarbon is replaced with a hydrogen atom, and the released sulfur is combined with two free hydrogens to form H2S gas. H2S gas is typically collected from the various conversion and hydrotreating units and converted into elemental sulfur in a sulfur plant. Once separated, sulfur can be sold as a low-value sulfur product, either as solid sulfur or in a molten state. The major use for sulfur is in the petrochemicals industry to produce sulfuric acid.
* Sulfur (product)	Sulfur is a major by-product of oil refining and gas processing. Most crude oil grades contain some sulfur, most of which must be removed during the refining process to meet strict sulfur content limits in refined products. This is typically done through hydrotreating and results in production of H2S gas, which is converted into elemental sulfur in the sulfur recovery unit. The resultant elemental sulfur is in a molten state and can either be sold as a heated liquid or (more commonly) converted to solid form as blocks or pellets. Most of the sulfur produced by refineries is sold into the petrochemicals market where it is used to make sulfuric acid. Processing of high-sulfur natural gas is also a large source of sulfur supply. Sulfur can also be mined from underground, naturally-occurring deposits, but this is more costly than sourcing from oil and gas and has largely been discontinued.
* Sulfur pile	The sulfur pile is the inventory of solid, elemental sulfur that builds up at a refinery sulfur plant as H2S is converted to elemental sulfur. Often this is literally a pile of sulfur in an open area waiting to be loaded on rail cars or ships for delivery to a buyer.
* Sulfur plant	Also known as: Claus unit, sulfur recovery, SRU The sulfur plant converts H2S gas into elemental sulfur that can then be sold as a finished product. The process results in a molten sulfur product that can either be sold directly in liquid form or converted into solid pellets by cooling with water. How it works The H2S-rich gas is fed into a reaction chamber with 1/3 the stoichiometric volume of air required to burn it. Burners convert 1/3 of the H2S to SO2, which then reacts with the remaining H2S (in the presence of an alumina catalyst) to form elemental sulfur. The resulting product is cooled to condense to liquid sulfur. The tail gas often contains small amounts of COS and CS2. To remove this, the tail gas is mixed with a small amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, heated, and reacted over a catalyst that converts the sulfur to H2S. This process is called the SCOT process. The H2S-rich gas can then be sent to the acid gas recovery plant and ultimately be recycled back into the sulfur plant as feed.
* Sulfuric acid	Sulfuric acid is both a catalyst used in the alkylation process and a product made from the sulfur recovered by refiners.
* Sullum Voe	Sullum Voe is the primary loading point for cargoes of Brent crude oil in the North Sea and the location for FOB price quotes for Brent.
* Support process units	In addition to the units that directly process hydrocarbons, a refinery will have a number of supporting units providing utilities and other services. These typically include: Gas plant - Separation of light ends (propane, butane) from refinery gas coming from distillation and all of the conversion units. Cracked gas will typically go to a dedicated unsaturated gas plant Acid gas recovery - Separation of H2S and CO2 from refinery gas Sulfur plant - Conversion of H2S to elemental sulfur Hydrogen production - Generation of hydrogen from natural gas or other hydrocarbons for use in hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers Hydrogen capture - Extraction of hydrogen from conversion unit gas Steam production - Generation of steam for process units Cooling water - Cooling water used in process units Waste water treating - Removal of contaminants from process and runoff water
* Sustaining capital	Sustaining capital refers to the ongoing (yearly) capital investment that a refinery must make to continue to operate. This includes maintenance capital and investment required to adapt to regulatory changes. It does not include investment for expansion or margin improvement (growth capital).
* Swap	A swap is a forward transaction in the over-the-counter (OTC) market, directly between two parties. It is a contract that trades price risk from one party to the other.
* Sweet	Also known as: low sulfur In refining, a crude oil grade is called sweet if it has a low sulfur content. As opposed to a sour crude, which is one with a high sulfur content. Typically, a sweet crude would be one with anything under 1% sulfur content, by weight.
* Sweetening	Sweetening is any refining process designed to reduce the sulfur content of a stream. This includes hydrotreating and merox treating.
* Swing cut	In fractional distillation of crude oil, a swing cut is the volume of crude where two distillation fractions overlap, which can be "swung" into one or the other fraction (or divided between them) by adjusting the cut point between the two fractions.
* Synbit	Synbit is an unconventional crude grade produced by mixing synthetic (upgraded) crude with raw bitumen. Synbit primarily comes from the Western Canadian oil sands.
* Synthesis gas	Synthesis gas is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen used as a feed into synthesis reactions such as the Fischer-Tropsch process. Synthesis gas is produced through gasification of a hydrocarbon such as coal or natural gas.
* Synthetic lubricants	Synthetic lubricants are made from base oils that have been through a conversion process such as hydrocracking or GTL synthesis. Non-oil based lubricants (from poly alpha olefins) are also synthetic.

============ T ============
* TAME	Also known as: Tertiary Amyl Methyl Ether TAME is an oxygenate gasoline blend stock produced by reacting methanol with an amylene (five-carbon olefin).
* Tank farm	A tank farm is a collection of crude and/or product storage tanks. Every refinery has a tank farm to hold crude while it is waiting to be processed and to hold products after they are blended and are waiting to be shipped to market.
* Tank wagon	Also known as: tank truck, fuel truck A tank wagon is a truck designed for delivery of liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel from fuel terminals to retail stations. Tank wagon can also refer to a wholesale pricing point for fuel, delivered to a retail station.
* Tanker	Also known as: wet cargo vessel, wet bulk carrier An oil tanker is a sea-going ship specifically designed to move large volumes of crude oil or refined product over long distances. Oil tankers are typically categorized as either dirty tankers (which move crude oil or dirty products such as residual fuel oil) or clean product tankers (which move clean products such as gasoline and diesel). Oil tankers are categorized by size or class based on their dead weight ton (DWT) capacity. The major size classes are: Coastal - 3-10,000 DWT typically used only in coastal waters. Clean product only Small - 10-20,000 DWT. Also called SR or short range. Clean product only Handy - 20-55,000 DWT. Clean product or crude. Also called MR or medium range if dedicated to clean product Panamax - 60-80,000 DWT. Largest tanker capable of transiting the Panama Canal. Clean product or crude. Also called LR1 if dedicated to moving light product over long distance Aframax - 80-120,000 DWT. Clean product or crude. Also called LR2 if dedicated to moving clean product over long distance Suezmax - 120-180,000 DWT. Largest tanker capable of transiting the Suez Canal. Crude only VLCC - 200-320,000 DWT. Crude only ULCC - 320-560,000 DWT. Crude only

* TBA	Also known as: Tertiary Butyl Alcohol TBA is an isomer of butanol. It is used as a finished refined product, a gasoline oxygenate blend stock, and an intermediate in the production of MTBE and ETBE.
* Technical support	In a refinery, the technical support group refers to the engineers who provide support for day-to-day operations. It often also includes the refinery laboratory group.
* Technology licensing	Technology licensing is the business of selling refinery process technologies to refiners. Most of the refining process units have a number of licensors with process technology designs that refiners can license when they build a new unit. Some of the more prominent licensors are: UOP Axens (IFP) CB&I (Chevron Lummus)
* TEPPCO pipeline	Also known as: Texas Eastern Product pipeline, Little Big Inch pipeline, Enterprise Products Pipeline System TEPPCO pipeline makes up most of the Enterprise Products Pipeline System that moves refined products from the Gulf Coast to the Upper Midwest (Illinois and Indiana). Description TEPPCO includes 3,423 miles of product pipeline running from the Gulf Coast of Texas to Eastern Indiana. 20" line with capacity to move 230 thousand barrels/day of LPG and gasoline from Houston to the Midwest 14/16" line with capacity to move 110 thousand barrels/day of middle distillates (diesel and jet fuel) and gasoline from Houston to the Midwest History TEPPCO was originally developed by the US Government in World War II as two pipelines moving crude and product from the Gulf Coast to the Upper Midwest and North East. 1944 - Original two lines were constructed and put into service: 24" Big Inch line moving crude from East Texas to Illinois and 20" Little Big Inch moving product from the Gulf Coast to Illinois and east to New York 1947 - Acquired by Texas Eastern and converted to natural gas service 1958 - Little Big Inch converted back to product service 1989 - Acquired by Panhandle Eastern 1990 - Refined products line spun off as TEPPCO MLP 2005 - General partner of TEPPCO MLP acquired by Enterprise Products 2009 - Merged into Enterprise Products Pipeline System 2013 - Northeastern part of system re-purposed to move ethane, limiting product service to Eastern Indiana destinations  
* Tetra-ethyl lead	Also known as: TEL Tetra ethyl lead is a gasoline additive that was once widely used to improve gasoline octane. Use of TEL has largely been eliminated worldwide due to the resulting buildup of lead in the environment that came with its widespread use.
* Thermal cracking	Thermal cracking is a process for cracking resid using only heat, no catalyst. Thermal cracking of VGO has largely been replaced by cat cracking. Visbreaking is a mild form of thermal cracking focused on reducing the viscosity of vacuum resid.
* Tier 3	Tier 3 is the gasoline sulfur regulation introduced in the US in 2017 that reduces the maximum average sulfur content of gasoline to 10 ppm.
* Time charter	Time charter is a ship charter for a period of time beyond a single voyage. It is essentially the leasing of a ship for an extended period of time to use as the lessee wants.
* Toluene	Toluene is a hydrocarbon with 7 carbon atoms that contains an unsaturated aromatic ring structure, plus one additional carbon atom. Essentially benzene plus an extra carbon. In a refinery, toluene is valued as a source of octane for gasoline blending. However, in gasoline, toluene content is also constrained by a limit on total aromatics content, because aromatics contribute to smog formation when lost to the atmosphere through evaporation. Toluene is also an important feedstock to the petrochemicals industry, so many refiners produce and extract toluene to sell as a product. The primary source of toluene in a refinery is from the reformate produced in the reformer.
* Topping	Topping is a very simple (low complexity) refining configuration consisting only of atmospheric distillation and hydrotreating.
* Tray	Also known as: bubble cap tray Tray refers to the levels in a fractional distillation tower at which hydrocarbons re-condense, resulting in separation based on boiling point. The trays traditionally used bubble caps to allow hydrocarbon flow and to encourage separation. Bubble caps are small, floating caps over holes in the tray that allow vapor to rise (bubble) through the tray but keep liquid from flowing back down. This results in a pool of liquid on the tray with vapor bubbling through it, resulting in good separation of hydrocarbon based on boiling point. 
* Treating processes	In refining, a number of process units focus on improving the quality of a hydrocarbon stream without changing the product mix of the refinery. Typically, this involves injecting hydrogen or extracting trace amount of contaminants. This category of process units includes: Hydrotreater - Used to treat a variety of hydrocarbons, using hydrogen under pressure to remove contaminants and/or saturate hydrocarbons Merox - Treats kerosene by oxidizing trace amounts of mercaptans
* Turnaround	In refining, a turnaround is a major maintenance event for a refinery process unit where the unit is taken out of service and opened up for cleaning, repair, and enhancement. Process units have turnarounds on a regular cycle of typically 3-7 years depending on the unit.

============ U ============
* Udex	Udex is a solvent extraction process for separating aromatics from reformate. The process uses diethylene glycol as the solvent.
* ULCC	Also known as: Ultra large crude carrier ULCC refers to the largest class of oil tanker, which is larger than VLCC. ULCC tankers are in the range of 320-560 DWT. They are used exclusively for crude oil shipping. ULCC crude tankers are typically used on long-haul routes. They can not go through the Panama or Suez Canals. They are also draft limited in which ports they can enter. Frequently, draft limits are avoided by lightering cargoes onto or off of ULCCs using smaller ships.
* ULSD	Also known as: Ultra low-sulfur diesel ULSD is the standard grade of on-road diesel in the US.
* Unleaded gasoline	Unleaded gasoline is any gasoline that does not have TEL added to increase octane. This accounts for the vast majority of gasoline in the market today, as the use of lead has largely been eliminated. The term "unleaded" effectively means "standard gasoline" at this point in most markets.
* Unsaturated	Unsaturated refers to a hydrocarbon that has not been saturated with hydrogen to eliminate multiple bonds or aromatic rings. This term can apply to olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.
* Unsaturated gas	Also known as: Cracked gas Unsaturated gas is refinery gas that comes from cracking units and contains unsaturated molecules such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene.
* UOP	Also known as: Universal Oil Products UOP is one of the major technology licensing firms for the process units used in refining.
* Upgrader	An upgrader is a plant used to lower the density of extra-heavy crude oil (bitumen) before sending it to market. Upgraders employ standard refining bottoms conversion processes such as cokers and resid hydrocrackers to crack extra-heavy crude into a mix of lighter components. Upgraders are most common in the Western Canada oil sands and the Orinoco Belt of Venezuela.
* Upstream	Also known as: E&P, Exploration and Production Upstream is the part of the petroleum value chain focused on finding, developing, and producing crude oil. This is in contrast to downstream, which is focused on processing crude oil and commercializing refined products.
* Urals crude	Urals is the most common export grade of crude oil from Russia and an important benchmark for the medium sour crude market in Europe.

* Utilities	Utilities refers to the non-hydrocarbon process units in a refinery such as power generation, water treatment, and steam generation.
* Utilization	Utilization is the ratio of refinery throughput (crude input) to refinery capacity, typically measured in percent.

============ V ============
* Vacuum distillation	Also known as: vac tower, vacuum unit, vacuum flasher, VDU The vacuum tower separates the atmospheric resid generated by the atmospheric distillation tower into its components by distilling the resid under a vacuum. The vacuum is critical for separating the VGO from vacuum resid to provide feed separately for the cracking units (FCC and hydrocracking) and deep conversion units (coker, visbreaker, asphalt). The heavier the crude processed, the larger the vacuum unit that will be required to separate the bottom of the barrel. How it works Atmospheric tower bottoms are injected into the vacuum tower under a pressure at about 1/20th of atmospheric pressure (typically 25 to 40 mmHg or lower). Under these low pressures, the atmospheric resid will vaporize at temperatures below those where it starts to crack. This allows separation of very heavy components without cracking. Inputs The feed to the vacuum is either atmospheric bottoms from the distillation tower or purchased reduced crude. Products There are two key distillation cuts that result from the vacuum distillation step: VGO or vacuum gasoil - Typically sent to the FCC or hydrocracker to be upgraded into light products. Usually separated further into light and heavy VGOs. Vacuum resid - Literally the bottom of the barrel. Typically blended into residual fuel oil or upgraded through a coker or visbreaker. This is also used to make asphalt, but this ordinarily requires cutting deeper to yield a heavier, more asphaltene-rich stream than is ideal for coker or visbreaker feed.
* Vacuum resid	Also known as: vac resid, residuum Vacuum resid is the heaviest of the distillation cuts. It is, literally, the bottom of the barrel. Vacuum resid is the bottoms cut from the vacuum distillation tower. If not upgraded, vacuum resid is blended into either residual fuel oil or asphalt. When blended into fuel oil, vac resid is valued less than the fuel oil that it produces, because its high viscosity typically requires that it be blended with some higher value "cutter stock" such as kerosene. When blended into asphalt, vacuum resid's high viscosity is an advantage, so this is a high-value use for vac resid. However, the market for asphalt is limited, so most vacuum resid is forced to find a different home. Alternatively, vacuum resid can be upgraded to yield light products. There are three refinery process units that can do this: the coker, the visbreaker, and the resid hydrocracker.
* Vanadium	Vanadium is one of the metals that occurs naturally in crude oil. Vanadium is a poison to some refining catalysts, and so the vanadium content of a crude oil can affect its market value.
* Vapor lock	Vapor lock is a condition when gasoline vapor forms somewhere in the fuel system of a vehicle, reducing or stopping the flow of fuel to the engine. Vapor lock is caused by fuel volatility being too high for the operating conditions of the vehicle. Vapor lock is avoided by controlling fuel volatility, essentially the vapor pressure and distillation profile of the fuel.
* Vapor lock index	Also known as: VLI The vapor lock index is the measure used to control the tendency of gasoline to form vapor lock in most markets outside of US. The measurement for VLI is calculated: VLI = 10x(Vapor pressure in kPa) +7x(% evaporated at 70C) Typical values range from 800 to 1,250, and lower VLI is better. In the US, vapor lock is controlled by the vapor-liquid ratio rather than VLI. Vapor-liquid ratio is the temperature at which gasoline forms a ratio of vapor volume to liquid volume that is equal to 20. The normal range for vapor-liquid ratio is 35 to 60 C (95 to 140 F). Higher vapor-liquid ratio is better.
* Vapor pressure	Also known as: RVP, Reid vapor pressure, vapour pressure Vapor pressure is an important quality specification for gasoline. Specifically, vapor pressure is a measure of the volatility of a fuel, or the degree to which it vaporizes at a given temperature. For gasoline, vapor pressure is important for both performance and environmental reasons. First, because gasoline engines require the fuel to be vaporized in order to burn, gasoline must meet a minimum vapor pressure to ensure that it is volatile enough to vaporize under cold start conditions. Engines also have a maximum limit for vapor pressure set by concerns over vaporization in the fuel line that can result in vapor lock, or a blocking of the fuel line. However, the most critical limit to vapor pressure in most markets now is environmental concern about evaporative emissions outside of the vehicle, which contribute to pollution. Typically, it is this concern that sets the critical maximum vapor pressure specification for most grades of gasoline. Measurement of vapor pressure The most common measure of vapor pressure for gasoline is Reid vapor pressure. This is the pressure, in psi (pounds per square inch) or kPa (kiloPascals), necessary to keep a liquid from vaporizing when at 100 F (37.8 C). Vapor pressure limits vary seasonally, with higher limits in the cold months and lower limits in the warm months. Typical ranges are 7-15 psi or 48-103 kPa. Vapor pressure does not blend linearly with volume. To estimate the vapor pressure of a blend, a vapor pressure index is used. This is simply: Vapor pressure index = (Vapor pressure)^(1.25) High and low vapor pressure blendstocks Most gasoline blendstocks have vapor pressures below the maximum specification for finished gasoline, so achieving the vapor pressure specification is not difficult. However, one of the highest vapor pressure blendstocks, butane, also happens to be very high in octane and very cheap relative to other blendstocks. Consequently, there is typically a strong incentive for refiners to blend as much butane into gasoline as possible, up to the point where it meets the maximum vapor pressure limit.
* Variable cash margin	Variable cash margin is one common measure of refinery margin or economic performance. Variable cash margin is typically calculated per barrel of crude oil processed and is equal to the gross margin, less variable costs such as energy, catalyst, and chemicals. Variable cash margin does not account for labor, materials, or other fixed costs. Variable cash margin is the metric most useful in assessing the value of adjusting utilization of the refinery in the short term, as it takes into account all of the elements of profit that change with different utilization. Consequently, it is the key measure of profitability against which the LP model will optimize.
* Variable costs	Variable costs are any costs that are tied to the volume of crude that a refinery processes, in contrast to fixed costs which are not volume dependent. Typically in a refinery, these include energy, catalysts, and chemicals.
* VGO	Also known as: vacuum gasoil VGO is one of the two outputs of the vacuum distillation tower (along with vacuum resid). VGO is the lighter material of the two. The primary use of VGO is as feed to cracking units such as the FCC or the hydrocracker. These units upgrade VGO into more valuable products, namely gasoline and diesel. If not upgraded, VGO is blended into residual fuel oil. However, this is fairly rare since the value of VGO is much greater as a feed into upgrading. Often, if a refinery lacks enough cracking to upgrade the VGO it generates, it will sell this as an intermediate to another refinery, rather than downgrading it by blending into residual fuel oil. VGO is often sub-divided into a lighter and heavier fraction called LVGO and HVGO, respectively.
* VGO hydrotreater	Also known as: Gas oil hydrotreater, FCC feed hydrotreater The VGO hydrotreater is used to reduce the sulfur in FCC feedstocks such as VGO before they are fed to the FCC. This reduces the sulfur in the FCC products and improves FCC yield.
* Visbreaker	Also known as: VBU In refining, the visbreaker is a mild bottoms conversion unit. It upgrades vacuum resid by cracking it so that viscosity is reduced and the amount of high-value cutter stock required to blend it into residual fuel oil is reduced. The conversion of vacuum resid into light products is very low in a visbreaker -- typically less than 15% by volume. However, the cost of a visbreaker is much lower than for other, more severe bottoms upgrading units. This makes it an attractive investment in markets where the demand for residual fuel oil is high.
* Viscosity	Viscosity is an important quality specification for residual fuel oil. Specifically, it is a measure of a liquid's resistance to flow. High-viscosity fuel oil is more difficult to pump and is therefore less desirable as a product. Refiners can manage fuel oil viscosity either through processing or through blending: Visbreaking- The visbreaker is a conversion process designed primarily to reduce the viscosity of vacuum resid by thermally cracking it Blending - The viscosity of resid can be reduced by blending it with a lower viscosity "cutter stock." This is typically either cycle oil, FCC slurry, or straight run kerosene
* Viscosity blend index	Also known as: VBI The VBI is an index used to calculate the viscosity of a blend of components of different viscosity. An index is required because viscosity does blend linearly with volume.
* VLCC	Also known as: Very large crude carrier VLCC refers to a class of large oil tanker, larger than Suezmax and smaller than ULCC. VLCC tankers are in the range of 200-320 DWT. They are used mostly for crude oil shipping, they but can also handle dirty products (residual fuel oil). VLCC crude tankers are typically used on long-haul routes. They can not go through the Panama or Suez Canals. They are also draft limited in which ports they can enter. Frequently, draft limits are avoided by lightering cargoes onto or off of VLCCs using smaller ships. 
* VOCs	Also known as: Volatile organic compounds VOCs are compounds in fuels that, when released into the atmosphere (usually from evaporative emissions), react to form air pollution. VOC limits are imposed on transportation fuels by environmental regulators in an effort to reduce pollution.

============ W ============
* Waterborne	Waterborne refers to any cargo of crude oil or refined product that is sold loaded on a ship. This is in contrast to "pipe" referring to a cargo sold in a pipeline or a storage tank at a pipeline.
* Wax	Wax is an undesirable component in base oils or distillates, but once removed it can be sold as a product. Wax is a refined product produced by solvent extraction from vacuum resid (in a dewaxing unit), typically as part of base oil production.
* Wet gas	Wet gas is natural gas that contains a significant volume of NGLs. This is in contrast to dry gas, which contains little or no NGLs.
* White oil	Also known as: Mineral oil, Paraffin oil White oil is is a specialty refined product used for non-fuel purposes such as food and cosmetics. It is a highly purified kerosene boiling range material that is clear and odorless.
* White spirit	Also known as: solvent naphtha, mineral spirit, varsol, mineral turpentine White spirit is a specialty refined product in the naphtha boiling range. It has a variety of uses including as an extraction solvent, a cleaner (paint thinner), or a degreaser. It is a common solvent in paints, lacquers, varnishes, aerosols, and asphalts.
* Working capital	Working capital is the inventory of crude oil and refined products maintained in a refinery to support operations. Working capital is an important component of the capital invested in a refinery. The volume of working capital required is a function of refinery size and the size, frequency, and variety of crude oil and refined product shipments into and out of the refinery. As a general rule, refiners try to keep working capital to a minimum.
* Worldscale	Worldscale is the market index system used for crude oil and refined product tanker chartering. The worldscale rate is a standardized estimate of the cost of moving a tanker on a given route. Charters are typically quoted and negotiated as a percent of this worldscale rate. Worldscale rates are updated and published each year. 
* WTI	Short for: West Texas Intermediate, TI, DSW, MEH WTI is a light sweet crude oil produced in the interior of the US. For many years, WTI was considered a global benchmark crude. This role has largely been displaced by Brent, but WTI remains an important regional benchmark for North America. There are three major locations where WTI prices are quoted: Midland - This is the price point closest to the actual production of WTI. It is one of the main gathering points for WTI in West Texas before it is sent by pipeline to the Gulf Coast, Cushing, or nearby refineries Cushing - Cushing is an intermediate transportation point where pipelines from producing regions (West Texas, Canada, Oklahoma) and to refining regions (Gulf Coast and Midwest) meet. The Cushing blend of WTI is also called Domestic Sweet Blend (DSW) Houston (Magellan East) - At this location on the Gulf Coast, crude arrives by pipeline from Cushing and Midland, and it is shipped by pipe to Gulf Coast refiners or exported by tanker to the international market. WTI blends in Houston are also called MEH WTI (and similar US domestic crudes) are primarily consumed by US refiners across the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions. WTI is also exported to the international market, largely through the ports of Corpus Christi and Houston. Quality: API: 40.8 Sulfur: 0.34%

In a refinery, xylene is valued as a source of octane for gasoline blending. However, in gasoline xylene content is also constrained by a limit on total aromatics content, because aromatics contribute to smog formation when lost to the atmosphere through evaporation. Xylene is also an important feedstock to the petrochemicals industry, so many refiners produce and extract xylene to sell as a product. The primary source of xylene in a refinery is from the reformate produced in the reformer.
