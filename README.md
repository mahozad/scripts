Added the [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) with this command:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/mahozad/<repo-name> <optional-folder-name>
```
... and also added its folder to IntelliJ in `Settings` ðŸ¡² `Version Control`. 

By choosing `Git` ðŸ¡² `Update Project`, if the submodules are on a branch, they will also be updated automatically.

If a submodule is in a detached HEAD state (a detached HEAD means a specific commit is checked out instead of a branch),
IntelliJ IDEA will call git submodule update, which will check out the commit referenced in the root repository.
This means an update will only be performed if the submodule reference changes in the root repo, or if a new submodule is added.

---

Update the pointer to another commit of the submodule-x by running these commands:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
git status
git add submodule-x
git commit -m "Update summodule-x pointer to latest commit"
```
